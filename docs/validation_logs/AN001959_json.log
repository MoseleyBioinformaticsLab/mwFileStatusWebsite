SCHEMA: Section "MS" does not match the allowed schema. Wrong key 'ACQUISITION_DATE' in OrderedDict([('INSTRUMENT_NAME', 'Thermo Q Exactive Orbitrap'), ('INSTRUMENT_TYPE', 'Orbitrap'), ('MS_TYPE', 'ESI'), ('ION_MODE', 'POSITIVE'), ('MS_COMMENTS', 'Mass spectral data were collected with a 10-minute gradient on a Thermo QExactive coupled with Dionex Ultimate 3000 (Thermo Fisher, San Diego, CA) set to collect data from m/z 85 to 1275 in positive ionization mode at 70,000 resolution. Three technical replicates were run for each sample using dual chromatography measuring both polarities (positive and negative) with a C18 column (Higgins Analytical, 100x2.1mm, 5uL). The right pump controls the gradient with Solvent A as 100% water, Solvent B as 100% Acetontrile, and Solvent C as 98% water with 2% Formic Acid. The left pump is set up to wash (Acetonitrile with 2% Formic Acid) one of the columns while the other column is running the gradient.
