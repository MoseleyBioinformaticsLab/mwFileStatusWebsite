Sections "PROJECT" contain missmatched items: {('PROJECT_SUMMARY', "Malassezia is one of the most abundant genera found on human skin; specifically, M. globosa is one of the yeast species dominant in this organ as it has been associated with several skin diseases. Malassezia cannot synthesize fatty acids. In response, the yeast cell intakes external fatty acids from the host or the growth media for survival. Several studies have focused on investigating the identity of lipids and enzymes in M. globosa to understand its lipid metabolism and the biology of the yeast cell-host interaction. In this work, we performed a supernatant lipidomic analysis on the mDixon media and the supernatant and on the M. globosa at early and late stationary phase (72h and 90h, respectively) to determine the lipid dynamics (lipids consumed vs. lipids secreted) between the growth media and the two stages of growth. We were able to identify 87 lipids within 17 classes of lipids; during the analysis, the increment of several lipids increased throughout time concerning the growth media, suggesting a secretion pattern from the cell to the media; some lipids found in this group were conjugated Sterols (ST) such as Glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), Glycerophospholipids (GP), specifically phosphocholine''s (PCs), Cardiolipins (CL), in particular those with chains of (47 to 54 carbons) and Sphingolipids (SP) such as Cer-PI which might have some role in pathogenicity. Likewise, the increment of some lipids decreased, but some only reduced at the late stationary phase (90h) only when the nutrients available was minimal. Finally, we observed a third pattern in which the amount of some lipids decreased throughout time (starting in the early stationary phase and finishing in the late stationary phase), hinting at a distinctive consumption pattern. The principal lipids consumed wereSterols (ST) bile acids, cholic acid, and its derivates, some phosphocholines (PCs), Fatty acyls (FA), and cardiolipins (CL). The consumption of these lipids was associated with different metabolic roles of the lipids in the cell as it lacks production of these lipids in M. globosa."), ('PROJECT_SUMMARY', "Malassezia is one of the most abundant genera found on human skin; specifically, M. globosa is one of the yeast species dominant in this organ as it has been associated with several skin diseases.

The mixture was homogenized with vortex for 15 min and sonicated for 30 min. The extracted lipids' organic phase was collected and dried on a Speed Vac. Then, the dry extract was re-dissolved in 1 mL of ACN containing 0.1% NH3·H2O (v/v), followed by strong anion-exchange solid-phase extraction using Strata SAX SPE-cartridge (55 uM, 70 A, 100 mg, 1 mL Phenomenex) which was pre-conditioned with 3 mL ACN. After sampling 1 mL of the lipid extract, the cartridge was washed with 3 mL acetone/H2O (1/9, v/v), 3mL acetone, and eluted with 3 mL formic acid/acetone (1/99, v/v) followed by evaporation using a Speed Vac.
