Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', "This study applied untargeted metabolomic techniques to investigate plasma metabolic profile changes in 147 individuals following consumption of a standard mixed meal. Time-series analyses identified dynamic responses in several key metabolic pathways and examined their associations with participants' metabolic health status. The results indicated considerable inter-individual differences in the amplitude and temporal patterns of metabolite changes, highlighting the significance of metabolic individuality.We found that substances such as Phenylalanine, allo-Inositol, Taurochenodesoxycholic acid, Succinic acid semialdehyde (notably listed twice), DNP-DL-Methionine, and 1,3,5-Trihydroxybenzene changed significantly after the standard mixed meal test (MMTT), and these changes were highly correlated with hormone fluctuations such as Insulin and Glucagon."), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', "This study applied untargeted metabolomic techniques to investigate plasma metabolic profile changes in 147 individuals following consumption of a standard mixed meal.
