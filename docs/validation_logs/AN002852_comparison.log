Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'Poor metabolic health, characterized by insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, is higher in people living with HIV (PLWH) and has been linked with inflammation, anti-retroviral therapy (ART) drugs, and ART-associated lipodystrophy (LD). Metabolic disease is associated with gut microbiome composition outside the context of HIV but has not been deeply explored in HIV infection nor in high-risk men who have sex with men (HR-MSM), who have a highly altered gut microbiome composition. Furthermore, the contribution of increased bacterial translocation and associated systemic inflammation that has been described in HIV-positive and HR-MSM individuals has not been explored. We used a multi-omic approach to explore relationships between gut microbes, immune phenotypes, diet, and metabolic health across ART-treated PLWH with and without LD; untreated PLWH; and HR-MSM. For PLWH on ART, we further explored associations with the plasma metabolome.'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'Poor metabolic health, characterized by insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, is higher in people living with HIV (PLWH) and has been linked with inflammation, anti-retroviral therapy (ART) drugs, and ART-associated lipodystrophy (LD).
