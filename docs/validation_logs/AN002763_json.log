SCHEMA: Section "STUDY" does not match the allowed schema. Wrong key 'CHEAR_STUDY' in OrderedDict([('STUDY_TITLE', 'Perfluoroalkyl substances and lipid composition in human milk'), ('STUDY_TYPE', 'CHEAR Study'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'PFAS are widely used in commercial products, and so humans have consistent exposure to them via oil- and water-resistant consumer products, fire- fighting foam, and industrial surfactants 1,2. The four PFASs commonly detected in blood, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) 3,4, are present in drinking water supplies both in northern New England as well as in 27 states nationally 5-8. Animal models shows that PFASs have can have effects on both the endocrine system and on adiposity 9-12. Epidemiological evidence shows that the presence of PFASs in maternal serum is associated with changes in maternal serum lipid and cholesterol composition 13,14. Similarly, serum levels of PFAS in adolescents have been associated with increases in serum cholesterol 15. These findings raise interesting questions about the association of PFAS and lipids in human milk. Research has shown the PFASs are present in human milk 16-18, and human milk is composed primarily of lipids 19. However, the relation between PFAS in milk and milk composition is unclear. The chemical and compositional profiles of breast milk are important because of the potential effects on the developing infant. The developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis suggests that early life exposures, such as toxins and nutrients via breast milk, have lasting effects on health, particularly obesity outcomes 20. In fact, some studies have shown associations between PFAS in maternal serum and infant birth weight and later childhood BMI 14,21. Our study will help to better illuminate the potential effects of maternal exposure to PFASs on infant exposure, both through direct transmission into breast milk and indirectly via influence on the lipid profiles of milk. To investigate how early life exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) may affect childhood health outcomes as mediated through breast milk, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Characterize the levels of PFAS in breast milk samples (n=495) in the NHBCS; 2. Characterize the lipid profiles of breast milk samples (n=495) in the NHBCS; 3. Test the relation between PFAS concentration and breast milk lipid profiles; and 4. Test the association between PFAS concentrations in maternal plasma collected during pregnancy with paired breast milk samples (n=100).'), ('INSTITUTE', 'Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai'), ('DEPARTMENT', 'Department of Environmental Medicine and Public Health'), ('LABORATORY', 'Mount Sinai CHEAR Untargeted Laboratory Hub'), ('LAST_NAME', 'Walker'), ('FIRST_NAME', 'Douglas'), ('ADDRESS', 'Atran Building RM AB3-39, 1428 Madison Ave'), ('EMAIL', 'douglas.walker@mssm.edu'), ('PHONE', '212-241-9891'), ('CHEAR_STUDY', '2018-2539')])
