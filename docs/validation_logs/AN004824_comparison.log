Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', "Lipidomic profiling was conducted on atrias and ventricles from 20 week old, male and female caPI3K and dnPI3K heterozygous and homozygous transgenic mice. These transgenic mice have cardiac specific overexpression of either a constitutively active PI3K transgene (to have increased PI3K activity in the heart, mimicking an athlete''s heart) or dominate negative PI3K transgene (to have decreased PI3K activity in the heart, resulting in smaller hearts with increase susceptibility to a variety of cardiac insults)."), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', "Lipidomic profiling was conducted on atrias and ventricles from 20 week old, male and female caPI3K and dnPI3K heterozygous and homozygous transgenic mice.
