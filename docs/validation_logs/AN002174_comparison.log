Sections "SAMPLEPREP" contain missmatched items: {('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', 'Each frozen bacterial pellet (~1 g) was thawed on ice and homogenized 3 times. For homogenization, 2.6 g of 0.1 mm zirconium beads and 6 mL 4 \x0eC MeOH/H2O (80/20) solvent was added and samples were agitated 7 times (210 s total) at 1600 rpm in a FastPrep 96 (MPBIO). Samples were then centrifuged at 416\x02 g and 4 \x0eC for 16 min and supernatant was transferred to a new 15 mL conical tube. Homogenization was carried out a second and third time using 4 mL MeOH/H2O with 4 homogenization cycles (150 s) and 2 mL MeOH/H2O with 3 homogenization cycles (150 s), respectively. Pooled supernatants from each sample were concentrated to dryness using a CentriVap Benchtop Vacuum Concentrator (Labconco). The extracts were reconstituted in 600 L of deuterated 100 mM sodium phosphate bu\x0ber (pH 7.4) containing 1 mM of the internal standard DSS (d6 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid) and vortex mixed 2 min. Each sample was transferred into 5 mm SampleJet NMR tubes for NMR analysis.'), ('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', 'Each frozen bacterial pellet (~1 g) was thawed on ice and homogenized 3 times.
