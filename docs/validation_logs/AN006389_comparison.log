Sections "SAMPLEPREP" contain missmatched items: {('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', "For Lung: 20 to 30 mg of tissues were weighed and added to a 2 mL round-tipped microtube with a – 80° C cold Yttria Grinding Ball per tube. The tissues were pulverized in CryoMill (Retsch) following alternating three cycles at 5 Hz for 2 min with three cycles at 25 Hz for 2 min. Buffer was added to each 2 mL microtube (sample weight x 40)/2 volume of the buffer) 40:40:20 buffer with 0.5% formic acid, samples were vigorously vortexed and incubated on ice for 10 minutes, vortexed, and incubated for an additional 10 min. After the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000g at 4° C, the supernatant A was collected and saved, and the pellets were submitted to re-extraction following the same procedure to generate supernatant B. Supernatant A and B were mixed and transferred to a clean 1.5 mL microtube with the appropriated volume of 15% NH4CO3. The samples were stored in a -80° C freezer until analysis by LC-MS. For Plasma: To extract polar metabolites from mouse plasma 40 µL of cold methanol was added to a 15 µL of mouse plasma in a 1.5 mL microtube. This mixture was vortexed for 10 seconds and incubated for 20 minutes in a -20° C freezer. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000g at 4° C. Next, supernatant A was collected in a new tube, and the pellet was saved for re-extraction. For re-extraction, the pellet was resuspended in 200 µL of 40:40:20 buffer, vortexed, and allowed to sit on ice for 10 min. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 g at 4° C. Supernatant B was collected and mixed with supernatant A. This mixture was further processed to remove phospholipids using 1 mL Phenomenex (Phenomenex Inc.) tubes according to the manufacturer's instruction and stored at -80° C until analysis by LC-MS."), ('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', "For Lung: 20 to 30 mg of tissues were weighed and added to a 2 mL round-tipped microtube with a – 80° C cold Yttria Grinding Ball per tube.
