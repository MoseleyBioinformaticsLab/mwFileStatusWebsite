Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'Detachments were created in adult male Brown-Norway rats (300?400 g; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). Briefly, rodents were anesthetized with a 50:50 mix of ketamine/xylazine, and pupils were dilated with topical phenylephrine (2.5%) and tropicamide (1%). A 20-gauge microvitreoretinal blade was used to create a sclerotomy 2 mm posterior to the limbus, carefully avoiding lens damage. A subretinal injector (Glaser, 32-gauge tip; BD Ophthalmic Systems, Franklin Lakes, NJ) was introduced through the sclerotomy into the vitreous cavity and then through a peripheral retinotomy into the subretinal space. Sodium hyaluronate (10 mg/mL, Healon OVD; Abbott Medical Optics, Uppsala, Sweden) was slowly injected to detach the neurosensory retina from the underlying RPE. In all experiments, approximately one third to one half of the neurosensory retina was detached. Detachments were created in the left eye. The right eye served as the control, with all the steps of the procedure performed except for introduction of the subretinal injector and injection of the sodium hyaluronate. At varying intervals after creation of the detachment, the animals were euthanatized, and the eyes were enucleated.The retina was then dissected away from the retinal pigment epithelium taking just the detached portion in those eyes experimentally detached. All experiments were performed in accordance with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and the guidelines established by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals of the University of Michigan.'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'Detachments were created in adult male Brown-Norway rats (300?400 g; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA).
