Sections "PROJECT" contain missmatched items: {('PROJECT_SUMMARY', "MoTrPAC is a national research consortium designed to discover and perform preliminary characterization of the range of molecular transducers (the molecular map) that underlie the effects of physical activity in humans. The program's goal is to study the molecular changes that occur during and after exercise and ultimately to advance the understanding of how physical activity improves and preserves health. Preclinical and clinical studies will examine the systemic effects of endurance and resistance exercise across a range of ages and fitness levels by molecular probing of multiple tissues before and after acute and chronic exercise. This program is the largest targeted NIH investment of funds into the mechanisms of how physical activity improves health and prevents disease. The MoTrPAC program is supported by the NIH Common Fund and is managed by a trans-agency working group representing multiple NIH institutes and centers, led by the NIH Office of Strategic Coordination, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institute on Aging, and National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering. MoTrPAC Steering Committee: Wendy Kohrt, Chair, Russ Tracy, Co-Chair; NIH Program Manager, Concepcion Nierras. Euan Ashley and Matthew Wheeler are the PIs for the Motrpac Bioinformatics / Data Coordination Center."), ('PROJECT_SUMMARY', 'MoTrPAC is a national research consortium designed to discover and perform preliminary characterization of the range of molecular transducers (the "molecular map") that underlie the effects of physical activity in humans.

Sections "ANALYSIS" contain missmatched items: {('ANALYSIS_DETAILS:', '9 isotopically labeled internal standards are used for the nucleotide quantitation (13C10, 15N5-AMP; 13C10, 15N5-GMP; 13C10, 15N2-UMP; 13C9, 15N3-CMP; 13C10-GTP; 13C10-UTP; 13C9-CTP; 13C10-ATP, and nicotinamide-1,N6-ethenoadenine dinucleotide (eNAD). Ion ratios of nucleotides to respective internal standards are computed from extracted ion chromatograms using a software package TargetLynx (Waters, Milford, MA). The ratios are converted to concentrations using calibrators prepared by spiking tissue homogenates with authentic nucleotides (Sigma, MO, USA). The values are expressed in pmol/mg.')}
