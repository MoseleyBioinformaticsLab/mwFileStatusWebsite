Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "Extraction of polar metabolites from plasma:To extract polar metabolites from mouse plasma 40 µL of cold methanol was added to a 15 µL of mouse plasma in a 1.5 mL microtube. This mixture was vortexed for 10 seconds and incubated for 20 minutes in a -20° C freezer. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000g at 4° C. Next, supernatant A was collected in a new tube, and the pellet was saved for re-extraction. For re-extraction, the pellet was resuspended in 200 µL of 40:40:20 buffer, vortexed, and allowed to sit on ice for 10 min. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 g at 4° C. Supernatant B was collected and mixed with supernatant A. This mixture was further processed to remove phospholipids using 1 mL Phenomenex (Phenomenex Inc.) tubes according to the manufacturer's instruction and stored at -80° C until analysis by LC-MS."), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "Extraction of polar metabolites from plasma:To extract polar metabolites from mouse plasma 40 µL of cold methanol was added to a 15 µL of mouse plasma in a 1.5 mL microtube.
