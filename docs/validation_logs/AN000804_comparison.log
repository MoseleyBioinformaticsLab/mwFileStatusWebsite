Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', 'A 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study will be conducted. After CTRC screening for inclusion/exclusion criteria, qualified subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups. The investigators involved in the acquisition and analysis of key outcomes will be blinded to the curcumin intake status of the subjects. With the assistance of dietary monitoring from the UC-Boulder CTRC bionutritionists, subjects will maintain their baseline diet with either unchanged (control) or enhanced curcumin intake delivered as capsules (Longvida®, Verdure Sciences): Group 1 = placebo (inert substances); Group 2 = curcumin (2000mg curcumin/day). Extensive published work has established that the curcumin dose of 2000 mg/day is well tolerated and safe. Sessions 1 & 2: Screening measurements. Session 3: Baseline measurements and blood draw. Sessions 4-8 (every other week to assess adherence and overall subject well-being): Body weight, BP, adherence, discuss any problems. Session 9: Identical to session 3 (stop intake of capsules after completion of post-testing).'), ('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', '"A 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study will be conducted.
