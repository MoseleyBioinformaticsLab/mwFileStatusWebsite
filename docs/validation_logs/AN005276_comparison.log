Sections "MS" contain missmatched items: {('MS_COMMENTS', "The mass spectrometer was set to full scan (70-1000 m/z), with the spray voltage set to 4.0 kV, heated capillary to 350°C, and the HESI probe at 30 °C. The sheath gas flow was set at 10 units, auxiliary gas at 1 units, and sweep gas flow at 1 unit. The resolution of scan was set to 70,000, AGC target to 1x106, and maximum injection time at 20 msec. Data acquired by Thermo Fisher''s Xcalibur software and analyzed by their Tracefinder software. The raw files provided contain data from both positive and negative ion mode."), ('MS_COMMENTS', "The mass spectrometer was set to full scan (70-1000 m/z), with the spray voltage set to 4.0 kV, heated capillary to 350°C, and the HESI probe at 30 °C.

Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', "The 143B cell line were cultured in Dulbecco''s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (ThermoFisher) supplemented with 10% Heat Inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (ThermoFisher) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (ThermoFisher), and 100 µg/mL uridine (Sigma). Cells were kept in a 37°C incubator (Baker Ruskinn) held at 5% CO2 and 90% relative humidity.Cells were then supplemented with either DMSO or HKJS003. For HKJS003, 20µL or 5µL of 100µM stock was added to 2mL of media for a final concentration of 100nM or 25nM. For DMSO, 20µL of a diluted 1:1000 DMSO was added to 2mL of media. The cells were incubated for 5-7 of days to proliferate and every 2 days the media was refreshed with the relevant treatments."), ('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', "The 143B cell line were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (ThermoFisher) supplemented with 10% Heat Inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (ThermoFisher) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (ThermoFisher), and 100 µg/mL uridine (Sigma).
