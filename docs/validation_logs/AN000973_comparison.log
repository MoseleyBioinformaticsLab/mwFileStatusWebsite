Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', '"Male and female American Indians 11-21 years old are being recruited from the Choctaw Nation Health Service Area of southeast Oklahoma. We use a collaborative approach as recently described by our American Indian Programs Coordinator (12). The primary characteristics of the three study groups are shown in Table 1. Group 1 is obese (Body mass index, BMI, ≥95th percentile for age- and sex-specific norms based on growth charts from the Centers for Disease Control), with pubertal maturation level ≥Tanner Stage 2, family history of T2D, and recent history of low physical activity. Low physical activity, defined as attaining <30 minutes of structured moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise on 3 days/week over the preceding 3 months, is confirmed through questionnaires and use of an accelerometer. Groups 2 and 3 are both classified as normal weight (BMI greater than 20th and less than 85th percentile) with maturation level ≥Tanner Stage 2. Group 2 will have low physical activity (same as Group 1), while Group 3 will have high physical activity, defined as >30 minutes of structured moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise on >3 days/week in the preceding 3 months. Additional eligibility criteria are: lack of diabetes or other potentially confounding metabolic disorders, able to safely exercise, willingness to complete the testing and participation schedule, and not on medications known to impact the stated outcomes. A medical history and physical exam is performed to assure suitability for the study during the initial screening."'), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'Male and female American Indians 11-21 years old are being recruited from the Choctaw Nation Health Service Area of southeast Oklahoma.
