Sections "CHROMATOGRAPHY" contain missmatched items: {('CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY', "The Agilent 1290 Infinity II Multisampler system was employed with a multiwash option, and 1 µL of extracted samples was injected. The multisampler temperature was maintained at 15 °C to ensure the stability of compounds and prevent lipid precipitation. For chromatographic separation, an Agilent InfinityLab Poroshell 120 ECC18 (3.0 × 100 mm, 2.7 µm) (Agilent Technologies) column and a compatible guard column (Agilent InfinityLab Poroshell 120 ECC18, 3.0 × 5 mm, 2.7 µm) were employed and held at 50 °C. The chromatography gradient was initiated at 70% of B at 0–1 min, increased to 86% at 3.5–10 min, and reached 100% B at 11–17 min. The initial conditions were restored by minute 17, followed by a 2-minute re-equilibration, resulting in a total running time of 19 min. The mobile phases for positive and negative ionization modes comprised (A) 10 mM ammonium acetate, 0.2 mM ammonium fluoride in a 9:1 water/methanol ratio and (B) 10 mM ammonium acetate, 0.2 mM ammonium fluoride in a 2:3:5 acetonitrile/methanol/isopropanol ratio. The flow rate was maintained at 0.6 mL/min. The multisampler's multiwash strategy involved a methanol:isopropanol (50:50, v/v) mixture with a 15-second wash time and an aqueous:organic phases (30:70, v/v) mixture to achieve the initial conditions."), ('CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY', "The Agilent 1290 Infinity II Multisampler system was employed with a multiwash option, and 1 µL of extracted samples was injected.
