Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', 'Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 parasites were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium and magnetically enriched to increase the infected to uninfected RBC ratio. Following hemocytometer counts, 1x10^8 parasites were measured per condition into 5 mL of total media for 2.5 hours in the presence of drug. No treatment or ND represents control parasites without additional alterations. Compounds (MMV...) are test compounds that were added at 10xIC50 value for the experimental duration. Blanks are sample tubes that follow the same procedures as samples following the quenching of metabolism. Both Pool and QC samples are combined samples of all samples from the analytical batch on that particular day. Dates in YYYYMMDD format are appended to individual samples to indicate the batch in which they were processed.'), ('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', 'Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 parasites were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium and magnetically enriched to increase the infected to uninfected RBC ratio.
