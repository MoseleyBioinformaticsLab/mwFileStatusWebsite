Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', '"DC vaccine treatment Naïve C57/BL6 mice were used for tumor implantation. B16F10-OVA (2 × 104 cells/brain) tumor cell lines were injected intracranially. Antigen specific T cells (3 × 107 cells/50 µL of PBS) were infused into the animals intravenous (IV) five days after tumor implantation and the DC vaccine (1x106 cells/50 µL of PBS per animal) was injected intradermally on the same day. Both antigen-specific T cells and DC vaccine were administered once. Urine samples were collected after DC vaccination at several timepoints. Finally, animals were euthanized when they reached the endpoints. Sample collection Each animal was in a separate chamber individually. The chamber bottom was covered with clean parafilm. Animals were kept in the chamber until urination. Urine drops were collected using sterile syringes. Samples were stored at -80 °C until further analysis. Serum samples were collected from peripheral blood. "'), ('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', 'DC vaccine treatment Naïve C57/BL6 mice were used for tumor implantation.
