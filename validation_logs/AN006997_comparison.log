Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', "Study conditions Human studies: Five patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma undergoing a radical nephrectomy were infused with 13C6 glucose from time of anaesthetic induction to sampling of tissues at time point 1 (95-145 minutes). At time point 1, tissue samples (between 1-3 samples) were taken from each patient''s tumour and adjacent healthy kidney. After the kidney was surgically removed (detached from blood supply), repeat tissue samples (between 1-3 samples) were taken from each patient''s tumour and adjacent healthy kidney. Mouse studies: All experiments were conducted in strict accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 by personnel with the appropriate personal licence. Eleven healthy male NSG mice (Charles River Laboratories, UK) were orthotopically xenografted with 786-O human ccRCC cells at between 8-13 weeks of age. All mice were housed in specific-pathogen-free animal facilities with ad libitum access to food and water. Mice were infused with 13C6 glucose for 60 minutes. Mice were euthanised at the end of the infusion and tissues immediately harvested. Tissue samples (both kidney and 786-O tumour) were divided into 4 equal pieces, one piece was immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and the other pieces left at room temperature in a petri dish for 5, 30, or 60 mins prior to freezing. Study summary: Human isotopic tracer studies are becoming the gold standard for studying cancer metabolism in vivo. Analysed tissues are typically retrieved after surgical resection exposing them to variable amounts of warm ischaemia. Although standardised protocols are emerging, the effects of sampling conditions on the tissue metabolome remain understudied. Here, we perform a 13C-glucose study coupled with metabolomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiling in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) to assess the impact of ischaemia on tissues sampled intraoperatively (blood supply intact) and post-surgical resection (tissues exposed to ischaemia). Although several metabolic features were preserved, we demonstrate that ischaemia significantly impacted other metabolic phenotypes of ccRCC, masking key features such as suppressed gluconeogenesis. Notably, kidneys were more metabolically susceptible to ischaemia than these VHL-mutant ccRCC tumours. Despite the overall stability of the proteome and transcription, we also identified subtle degrees of ischaemia-induced perturbations. Using orthotopic ccRCC-derived xenografts, we evidenced that prolonged exposure to ischaemia disrupted the tissue metabolome stability. Overall, minimising tissue ischaemia is pivotal in accurately profiling cancer metabolism in these important and resource-intense patient studies."), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', "Study conditions Human studies: Five patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma undergoing a radical nephrectomy were infused with 13C6 glucose from time of anaesthetic induction to sampling of tissues at time point 1 (95-145 minutes).
