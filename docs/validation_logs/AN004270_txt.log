Tissues were collected from 10-12 rats sedentary control rats concurrent with the collection of the 8-week training groups. The 8-week training group and controls were from the same cohort and same age at euthanasia (either 8). For the older age group, an additional set of controls (n=5-6) were collected with the 1-2 week training group. Rats were either sedentary or underwent an exercise training program. Rats were exercised on the rodent treadmill 5 days per week using a progressive training protocol designed to exercise the rats at approximately 70% of VO2max as outlined in the Table on the next page. Training was performed no earlier than 10:00 am and no later than 5:00 pm over 5 consecutive days per week. Training was initiated with the treadmill set at 70% of VO2 max (see tables) and 5 degrees grade for 20 minutes. The duration of exercise was increased by one minute each day until day 31 of training (start of week 7), when a duration of 50 min was reached. Speed and grade of each training session increased in larger increments due to treadmill parameters. The highest intensity and duration of training began on day 31. This intensity was maintained for the final 10 days of the protocol to ensure steady state had been achieved. If any rats were unable to perform at least 4 days of training per week they were removed from the study and euthanized. It is important to note that the starting treadmill speed varied depending on the sex and age of the rat. The initial and maximum speeds were based on VO2max measurements obtained during the pre-training testing of the compliant rats. Rats assigned to the control group followed a schedule similar to the training group. They were placed in one lane on the treadmill for 15 minutes/day, 5 days per week. The treadmill was set at 0 m/min at an incline that corresponded to the incline being used by the training group.'), ('#METABOLOMICS WORKBENCH', '\n'), ('DATATRACK_ID', '3913'), ('VERSION', '1'), ('CREATED_ON', 'April 25, 2023, 7:56 am'), ('INSTITUTE', 'Mayo Clinic'), ('DEPARTMENT', 'Internal Medicine'), ('LABORATORY', 'Mayo Clinic Metabolomics Resource Core (MCMRC)'), ('LAST_NAME', 'Nair'), ('FIRST_NAME', 'K.
