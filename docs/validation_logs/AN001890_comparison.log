Sections "SUBJECT" contain missmatched items: {('ANIMAL_FEED', 'CHOW diet (Envigo Teklad 6% fat 7002, Madison, WI) and Western (H.D  high-fat, high-sugar; 21% milk fat and 34% sucrose (Envigo TD.08811)'), ('ANIMAL_FEED', 'CHOW diet (Envigo Teklad 6% fat 7002, Madison, WI) and Western (HFD; high-fat, high-sugar; 21% milk fat and 34% sucrose (Envigo TD.08811)')}
Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', 'Male C57BL/6 mice, 3 months of age, (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine) were allowed to acclimate for one week before experiment start. Mice were individually housed under controlled conditions (12:12 light-dark cycle, 50–60% humidity, and 25° C) and had ad libitum access to standard CHOW diet (Envigo Teklad 6% fat 7002, Madison, WI). Lipids in the CHOW diet consisted of an assortment of fatty acids where linoleic > oleic > palmitic > linolenic > stearic. Following a baseline glucose tolerance test (GTT), mice were grouped according to mean GTT and body mass into a standard 5 week CHOW (n = 10) or Western (H.D  high-fat, high-sugar; 21% milk fat and 34% sucrose (Envigo TD.08811); 5 (n = 5) and 13 week (n = 6)) diet group.
