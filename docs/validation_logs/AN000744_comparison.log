Sections "SAMPLEPREP" contain missmatched items: {('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', 'Step 1: After randomization of the samples, every preweighted intact frozen liver tissue was homogenized by a Tissue Tearsor (Model 985-370, BioSpec Product, Inc.) in ice-cold after adding 4 ml MeOH and 0.85 ml deionized H2O per gram of liver tissue, followed by vortexing the mixture and then 2 ml chloroform per gram of tissue was added and vortexed again. This process took 6 minutes and kept exactly the same for each sample. Step 2: 2 ml chloroform and 2 ml deionized H2O per gram of tissue were added in the mixture then vortexed again, followed by transferring the different layers into glass vials separately with syringes after the mixture (in ice bath) centrifuged. Finally, the solvents of hydrophilic metabolites were removed by employing lyophilizer and then stored at -80oC freezer before NMR spectral measurements.'), ('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', '"Step 1: After randomization of the samples, every preweighted intact frozen liver tissue was homogenized by a Tissue Tearsor (Model 985-370, BioSpec Product, Inc.) in ice-cold after adding 4 ml MeOH and 0.85 ml deionized H2O per gram of liver tissue, followed by vortexing the mixture and then 2 ml chloroform per gram of tissue was added and vortexed again.
