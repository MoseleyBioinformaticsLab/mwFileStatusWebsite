The sample size was determined based on the primary outcome of the overall study, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein content, as previously described [Transfusion. 2022;62(12):2490-2501]. Male subjects, aged 18-35 years, were allocated to participate in this part of the open-label randomized controlled study. Subjects underwent a pre-participation screening process, which included a review of their medical history, assessment of vital signs, physical examinations, and laboratory tests encompassing blood and urine analysis. Subjects were prohibited from engaging in any other intervention trials both three months before and after the study. Prior to enrollment, all volunteers provided written informed consent. In our current analysis, solely subjects (n=24) who received a platelet transfusion were included. The study procedures have been reviewed and approved by the Amsterdam UMC Medical Ethical Committee (2014_294#B2014961) and are according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP). The study is registered at the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP): NL-OMON26852. Randomization and blood donation The first 12 subjects (part I) were allocated to receive Escherichia coli (O113) lipopolysaccharide (LPS; dose 2 ng/kg; lot number 94332B1) to incite an inflammatory condition through toll-like receptor 4 stimulation, whereas the last 12 subjects (part II) received an equal volume of physiological saline (0.9% [w/v] sodium chloride) as control [Blood. 2006;107(2):637-641 and Platelets 2016;27(5):479-483.]. Subjects were scheduled to participate twice, once with and once without LPS, with a minimum interval of one year between sessions. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive one of the following: short-term stored autologous PCs (2 days stored) or long-term stored autologous PCs (7 days stored). Treatment allocation concealment was achieved by generating a randomization sequence using R (version 4.3.2, Boston, MA, USA). The sequence was placed in consecutively numbered opaque envelopes, which were opened only after each subject's inclusion. Depending on group allocation, the subjects donated 1 unit (± 300 mL) of apheresis platelets 2 or 7 days before the study day at Sanquin Blood Bank. Apheresis PCs were obtained and stored in compliance with Dutch Blood Bank standards, and preserved in 100% platelet additive solution E (PAS-E). The trial was conducted as an open-label randomized study, as subjects were required to donate either 2 or 7 days before the experiment."), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "Subjects and design: This study is part of a larger study on the influence of storage time of platelet concentrates in a two-hit healthy volunteer model on transfusion-related acute lung injury; the results of this study must therefore be considered exploratory [Transfusion. 2022;62(12):2490-2501.].
