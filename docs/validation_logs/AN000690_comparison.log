Sections "SAMPLEPREP" contain missmatched items: {('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', 'Aliquots of each de-identified sample were shipped to the NIH RTI-RCMRC on dry ice and immediately stored at -80 °C after being logged in for metabolomics analysis. A total of 66 study samples were thawed on ice for sample preparation. A 300 uL aliquot of plasma was transferred to new labeled tubes for each study sample. Analytical quality control (QC) phenotypic pooled samples were generated by transferring a 80µL aliquot of each sample from each respective phenotypic group (Control-women, BCa-women, Control-men and PCa-men) into different 1.5 mL tubes. Phenotypic pooled samples were vortexed and 300 uL aliquots were transferred into 3 tubes/group. A total study pool was generated by transferring 250 uL of plasma from each Phenotypic pooled sample into a new 1.5 mL tube. The Total Pool sample was vortexed and 300 uL aliquots were transferred into 3 Total Pool-labeled tubes. For extraction, 900 uL of MeOH was added to all tubes, they were vortexed for 2 min on a multi-tube vortexer and centrifuged at 16,000 rcf for 5 min. A 1000 µl aliquot of the supernatant was transferred into pre-labeled 2.0mL LoBind Eppendorf tubes, and samples were lyophilized to complete dryness overnight. Samples were reconstituted with 700 uL of NMR Master Mix solution containing Chenomx ISTD: DSS-d6 and Phosphate Buffer at 7.4 pH. The tubes were vortexed for 2 min on a multi-tube vortexer and centrifuged at 16,000 rcf for 5 min. A 600uL aliquot of supernatants were transferred into a pre-labeled 5mm 4" NMR tubes for data acquisition on a 700 MHz spectrometer.'), ('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', 'Aliquots of each de-identified sample were shipped to the NIH RTI-RCMRC on dry ice and immediately stored at -80 °C after being logged in for metabolomics analysis.
