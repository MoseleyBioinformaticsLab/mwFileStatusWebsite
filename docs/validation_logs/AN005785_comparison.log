Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', 'iPSCs were differentiated into iPSC-MN following a protocol described elsewhere (Guo et al., 2017, DOI: 10.1038/s41467-017-00911-y & Maury et al., 2015, DOI: 10.1038/nbt.3049) with slight modifications. Neuronal basal medium (vol:vol DMEM/F-12 (Gibco, #31331-028) and Neurobasal (Gibco, #21103-049)) was supplemented with N2 (Gibco, #17502048), B-27 (Gibco, #17504044), 0.1mM L-ascorbic acid (Santa Cruz, #sc-394304), 50µg/mL Uridine (Sigma, #U3003) and 100µg/mL primocin (InvivoGen, #ant-pm-05). For neural induction and caudalization to obtain neuroepithelial progenitor (NEP) cells, iPSCs were dissociated using EDTA and 10⁵ cells / cm2 were plated on ultra-low attachment dishes. On day 0, neuronal basal medium was supplemented with 3 μM Chir-99021 (Selleckchem, #S1263), 40 μM SB431542 (Millipore, #616461), 0,2 μM LDN-193189 (Sigma, #SML0559) and 5 μM Y-27632 (Selleckhem, #S6390). The medium was replaced the following day. From day 2 to 6, media was changed to neuronal basal medium supplemented with 0.1 μM retinoic acid (ThermoFisher, #044540-04) and 0.5 μM SAG (Millipore, #566660). On day 7, medium was replaced with neuronal basal medium supplemented with retinoic acid and SAG as previously, plus 10ng/ml BDNF (Peprotech, #450-02) and GDNF 10ng/ml (Peprotech, #450-10). On day 9, medium was replaced as previously, and 20 μM DAPT (Sigma, #D5942) was added to the fresh media. On day 10, the motor neuron spheres were dissociated into single cells with Accumax (Invitrogen, #00-4666-56), and motor neuron progenitors were plated on 50 μg/ml poly-D-lysine (Millipore, #633307) and 10 μg/ml laminin (Sigma, #L2020) coated plates at 60 000 cells / cm2. On day 11, fresh medium was added to the wells. On day 14, half of the medium was replaced with neuronal basal medium supplemented only with DAPT, BDNF and GDNF. From day 16 on, we used neuronal basal medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml BDNF, GDNF and CNTF (Peprotech, #450-13) and replaced half of the culture medium every other/third day. All the experiments were performed on day 30 unless otherwise indicated. Occasionally, flat cells (other neuronal types and progenitors) appear in the motor neuron culture. However, we only used dishes containing pure motor neurons for our studies to avoid confounding results.'), ('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', 'iPSCs were differentiated into iPSC-MN following a protocol described elsewhere (Guo et al., 2017, DOI: 10.1038/s41467-017-00911-y & Maury et al., 2015, DOI: 10.1038/nbt.3049) with slight modifications.
