Antigen specific T cells (3 × 107 cells/50 µL of PBS) were infused into the animals intravenous (IV) five days after tumor implantation and the DC vaccine (1x106 cells/50 µL of PBS per animal) was injected intradermally on the same day. Both antigen-specific T cells and DC vaccine were administered once. Urine samples were collected after DC vaccination at several timepoints. Finally, animals were euthanized when they reached the endpoints. Sample collection Each animal was in a separate chamber individually. The chamber bottom was covered with clean parafilm. Animals were kept in the chamber until urination. Urine drops were collected using sterile syringes. Samples were stored at -80 °C until further analysis.
