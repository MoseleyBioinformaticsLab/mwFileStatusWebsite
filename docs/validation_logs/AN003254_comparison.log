Sections "MS" contain missmatched items: {('MS_COMMENTS', 'For standard measurements on the Agilent Infinity 1290 + Bruker maXis II system MS data was acquired over a range from 50 to 2000 m/z in positive mode. Auto MS/MS fragmentation was achieved with rising collision energy (for single charged ions: 35–70 eV over a gradient from 500 to 2000 m/z; for double charged ions: 25–50 eV over a gradient from 500 to 2000 m/z). Calibration of mass spectra was achieved using sodium formate in H2O/ iPrOH (1:1) as internal standard. Mass spectra were analysed using Bruker Data Analysis 4.2 software (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Masses of the expected compounds were determined using ChemDraw Professional 16.0.1.4 (PerkinElmer, Waltham, USA) and recorded chromatograms were extracted for the respective m/z. Ions with fitting m/z (Δ less than 10 ppm) and plausible retention time were fragmented and fragments were matched to in silico identified plausible decay products.'), ('MS_COMMENTS', 'For standard measurements on the Agilent Infinity 1290 + Bruker maXis II system MS data was acquired over a range from 50 to 2000 m/z in positive mode.
