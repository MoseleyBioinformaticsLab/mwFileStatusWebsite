Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "De-identified clinical samples were collected from a subset of adult patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) who received investigational CD19-specific CAR T cells in a phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT02146924) at City of Hope. Patient or donor''s Tcells were collected by leukapheresis. The leukapheresis Tcells were used for metabolomics profiling. For CAR T cells, PBMC were depleted of CD14+ monocytes and CD25+ Tregs, followed by positive selection of CD62L+ T cells. Tcm-derived CAR T cells were purified, transduced, formulated, and released. The CAR T cells treated with or without rapamycin were used for metabolomics profiling. After 28th day post CAR-T infusion bone marrow serum was collected from the patients for metabolomics profiling"), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "De-identified clinical samples were collected from a subset of adult patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) who received investigational CD19-specific CAR T cells in a phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT02146924) at City of Hope.
