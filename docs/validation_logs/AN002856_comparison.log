Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'Project represents an effort to modify chromatographic conditions for improved compound identification in untargeted metabolomics. Two different modes of chromatograph (HILIC and RPLC) and multiple run conditions (sample loading, gradient duration, iterative acquisition) were evaluated. All relevant data from different conditions are contained within the raw data archive file attached to this submission. Metadata associated with this Metabolomics Workbench submission reflects only the manually reviewed identifications obtained using modified HILIC conditions. See protocol file Mod_vs_Con_Chrom_IDs_Protocol.pdf for details.'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'Project represents an effort to modify chromatographic conditions for improved compound identification in untargeted metabolomics.
