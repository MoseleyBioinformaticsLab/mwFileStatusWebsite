Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'The material for this study was selected from a clonal field trial established in 2016 in Snogeholm, Sjöbo, Sweden (55°32\'57.4"N 13°42\'29.4"E). The trial consisted of 65 replicated ash genotypes: 56 tolerant F. excelsior trees selected from around Sweden, four known susceptible F. excelsior genotypes, and five genotypes representing three Fraxinus species of Asian origin. The Asian ash include: F. mandshurica native to China, Japan, Korea, Eastern Russia; F. platypoda native to China and Japan and, F. chinensis native to northern China, Korea, Japan, south-east Russia (Wallander, 2013). Visually healthy leaf and shoot samples (including bark and phloem) were collected in June 2020 from 13 F. excelsior genotypes varying in disease severity to H. fraxineus (9 tolerant-ET and 4 susceptible-ES) based on periodic assessments, and from all five resistant Asian ash genotypes (AT) (Table S1). Up to five ramets (replicates) per genotype were collected depending on the amount of available tissue. A total of 92 samples were collected in the field, 46 leaves and 46 phloem from the current year shoots. Collected samples were placed in plastic bags and kept on dry ice then stored at -80°C until further processing.'), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "The material for this study was selected from a clonal field trial established in 2016 in Snogeholm, Sjöbo, Sweden (55°32''57.4N 13°42''29.4E).
