Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'Prior to sacrifice, rats were fasted between 8 and 12 h,their body weights recorded, and blood was collected from the tail as above prior to euthanasia. Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and euthanized with a 1 mL/kg intracardiac injection of saturated potassium chloride. Once cardiac movement had stopped for 30 s the rat was decapitated and the hypothalamus, liver, pancreas, heart, mesenteric adipose tissue, quadriceps, kidney, gonadal adipose tissue, inguinal adipose tissue, and brown adipose tissue were collected. All tissues were removed in the order listed above, wet weighed, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen'), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', '"Prior to sacrifice, rats were fasted between 8 and 12 h,their body weights recorded, and blood was collected from the tail as above prior to euthanasia.
