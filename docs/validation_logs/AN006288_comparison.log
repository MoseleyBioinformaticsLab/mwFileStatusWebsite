Sections "MS" contain missmatched items: {('MS_COMMENTS', "The data acquisition process used Agilent MassHunter Workstation Data Acquisition software (version B.05.01). Raw data files in Agilent '.d' format were processed using MassHunter Profinder software. The software utilized a batch molecular feature extraction algorithm with parameters set at a threshold of 1000 counts and a maximum charge state of 2. In negative ionization mode, adduct formation of −H and +HCOO was utilized to identify features of the same molecule. Feature alignment was performed with a tolerance window of 0.30 min and mass accuracy of 5 ppm for retention times and m/z values across all data files. Subsequently, feature-extracted data files were exported from Profinder as '.CEF' files for each profiling experiment."), ('MS_COMMENTS', "The data acquisition process used Agilent MassHunter Workstation Data Acquisition software (version B.05.01).
