Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'Blood samples were collected from gilts at 48 h postnatal. Gilts were euthanized approximately 48 h after birth using CO2 inhalation. Following euthanasia, skin of the abdominal and genital regions was cleaned thoroughly using 70% ethanol, and vaginal swabs were taken using a cytology brush (Puritan 2196 Removable Stiff Bristle Tip Brush; QuickMedical; Issaquah, WA) by inserting the tip of the brush into the vulva angled dorsally at 45˚. Once inserted to the base of the bristles, the brush was rotated 360˚ against the vaginal surface. Two consecutive swabs were collected from each animal, and swabs were placed in separate 15 ml sterile polypropylene conical tubes (Falcon™, Fisher Scientific, San Jose, California) and immediately placed on dry ice for transport. Samples were stored in a -80°C freezer until lipid extraction and analysis. Sows were milked during farrowing, and at 24 h after delivery of first piglet. For milk collection piglets were removed from the sow for approximately an hour and then 1 ml oxytocin (VetOne; Boise, ID; 20 USP/ml) was administered IM using a 20g x 1.5-inch needle into the vulva to stimulate milk letdown. Colostrum samples were collected manually from all teats and combined to create a uniform sample. Samples were stored until further analysis at -20°C'), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'Blood samples were collected from gilts at 48 h postnatal.
