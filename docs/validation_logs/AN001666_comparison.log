Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', 'Cancer cachexia is a multi-factorial syndrome accompanying advanced cancer, with the most notable symptom being unintentional weight loss. Cachectic patients lose both adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, with skeletal muscle loss and its associated weakness contributing to the morbidity and mortality of these patients. Despite three decades of research into mechanisms driving muscle wasting due to cancer, to date, an approved pharmacological therapy to prevent or treat cancer cachexia is still lacking. Our laboratory focuses on cancer cachexia in patients with pancreatic cancer, as up to 85% of these patients experience weight loss. Cachexia often occurs early in the progression of pancreatic cancer, making clear that cachexia in these patients is not simply a result of end-stage disease. Further, with perhaps more than ¼ of all pancreatic cancer deaths resulting from muscle weakness as opposed to tumor burden, cachexia also significantly contributes to mortality due to pancreatic cancer. Because little progress has been made in improving treatment outcomes, addressing cancer-induced muscle wasting is perhaps the best strategy to prolong pancreatic cancer patient survival and increase patient quality of life. In an effort to better understand the mechanisms driving pancreatic cancer-induced muscle wasting, the Cancer Cachexia Program at Ohio State University has begun a Pancreatic Cancer Cachexia Tissue Bank. To date, over 130 patients undergoing attempted resection for pancreatic cancer or other abdominal surgeries have donated muscle and blood to our bank. A unique aspect of our tissue bank is our focus on patients eligible for resection. In contrast to other studies using patients with late-stage disease, our patients are not end-stage, as they are considered healthy enough to undergo a major operation.'), ('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', '"Cancer cachexia is a multi-factorial syndrome accompanying advanced cancer, with the most notable symptom being unintentional weight loss.
