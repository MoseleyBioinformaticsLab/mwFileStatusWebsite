Sections "PROJECT" contain missmatched items: {('PROJECT_SUMMARY', 'Mesoscale eddies are a dominant source of variability in the ocean\'s gyres, often analogized to the "weather" of the sea. They alter the balance between light and nutrients, shifting community composition on both the species and molecular scale. Here, we collected metabolomic samples from across eddy dipoles in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre to detect and quantify these shifts on a chemical level. The data indicate that metabolites dynamically and robustly track with biological community metrics and result in biochemically distinct particulate matter in cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies.'), ('PROJECT_SUMMARY', "Mesoscale eddies are a dominant source of variability in the ocean's gyres, often analogized to the weather of the sea.
