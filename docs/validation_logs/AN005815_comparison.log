Sections "MS" contain missmatched items: {('MS_COMMENTS', 'Mass spectrometry acquisition was performed using an Agilent 6550 iFunnel Q-TOF LC/MS system in both positive and negative ionization modes, covering m/z 60 to 1000 at a scan rate of 1 spectrum per second. Data processing utilized XCMS Online (version 3.7.1) for feature identification and normalization, with raw files converted to .mzML format via ProteoWizard. Control and unexplained infertility (UI) group data in .mzML format were subsequently uploaded as separate datasets to XCMS Online for pairwise comparison. Differentially expressed metabolites in the follicular fluid (FF) were identified and forwaded through MetaboAnalyst\'s "MS Peaks to Pathways" function. The Mummichog algorithm was employed to identify enriched metabolic pathways using a p-value threshold of 0.001, with the KEGG database for Homo sapiens serving as the reference for metabolite annotation and pathway assignment.'), ('MS_COMMENTS', "Mass spectrometry acquisition was performed using an Agilent 6550 iFunnel Q-TOF LC/MS system in both positive and negative ionization modes, covering m/z 60 to 1000 at a scan rate of 1 spectrum per second.
