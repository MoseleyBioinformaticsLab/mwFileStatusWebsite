Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'OC samples: muscle biopsy samples collected from insulin sensitive / insulin resistant obese indivduals before undergoing a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Subjects were previously categorized for the rate of fatty acid release from adipose tissue into the bloodstream as a measure of insuline resistance. Low-FA, Med-FA, and High-FA stand for low, medium, and high rate of release.'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', '"OC" samples: muscle biopsy samples collected from insulin sensitive / insulin resistant obese indivduals before undergoing a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.
