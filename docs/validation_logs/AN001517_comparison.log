Sections "CHROMATOGRAPHY" contain missmatched items: {('CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY', 'Metabolites were made volatile with trimethylsilyl (TMS) groups using N-methyl- N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide or MSTFA with catalytic trimethylchlorosilane at 50 C. GC/MS methods generally follow those of Roessner et al. (Roessner et al. 2000), Fiehn et al. (2008), and Kind et al. (2009), and used a 6890N GC connected to a 5,975 inert single-quadrupole MS (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The two wall-coated, open-tubular (WCOT) GC columns connected in series are both from J&W/Agilent (part 122-5512), DB5- MS, 15 m in length, 0.25 mm in diameter, with an 0.25-lm luminal film. Positive ions generated with conventional electron-ionization (EI) at 70 eV are scanned broadly from 600 to 50 m/z in the detector throughout the 45 min cycle time.'), ('CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY', 'Metabolites were made volatile with trimethylsilyl (TMS) groups using N-methyl- N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide or MSTFA with catalytic trimethylchlorosilane at 50 \x03C.
