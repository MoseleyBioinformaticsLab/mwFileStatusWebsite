Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', "Cells were grown to full confluence and held for 3-days in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). 24 hours prior to infection, cells were starved of serum in DMEM lacking FBS. Cells were HCMV-infected or mock-infected in serum-free DMEM for 1 hour. 1 hpi, 13C-choline isotopic tracer was fed to cells in serum-free growth medium we previously prepared (based on the published DMEM Gibco recipe). Tracer media contains 13C-choline in place 12C-choline. Tracer molecule was added at the same concentration non-tracer molecule is normally present in DMEM (13C-choline (4mg/L)). Medium was replaced at 48 hpi."), ('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', "Cells were grown to full confluence and held for 3-days in Dulbecco''s modified eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). 24 hours prior to infection, cells were starved of serum in DMEM lacking FBS.
