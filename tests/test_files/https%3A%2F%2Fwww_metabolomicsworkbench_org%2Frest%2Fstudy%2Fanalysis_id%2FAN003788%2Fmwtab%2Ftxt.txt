#COLLECTION
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	320 mL of diatom cells were collected by filtering the culture onto
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	2.0-µm-pore-size PCTE membrane filters (MilliporeSigma Isopore). Filters were
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	kept in 50 mL tubes (Falcon) and stored at -80oC until processing.

#TREATMENT
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	Six treatments of a marine diatom strain Thalassiosira pseudonana CCMP1335 were
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	prepared: treatments incubated axenically at either 14, 20, or 28 oC, and
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	treatments co-cultured with a bacterial strain Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3 at the
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	corresponding temperatures (four replicates for each). L1 media was used with
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	NaH13CO3 as a source of bicarbonate. The diatom used for the co-cultured
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	treatments was B12 stressed to emphasize the known co-existing system. The light
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	cycle consisted of 16 h light (120 µmol photons m-2 s-1) and 8 h of dark.

SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	in ultra-pure water (Millipore), concentrated by a lyophilizer (Labconco), and
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	kept -80oC until further processing. The samples were mixed with 600 µL of 30
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	mmol L-1 sodium phosphate buffer (18 mmol L-1 NaHPO4, 12 mmol L-1, pH 7.4) and

SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	L-1), vortexed at 4oC for 5 minutes, centrifuged at 20,800 rcf using an
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	ultracentrifuge 5417C (Eppendorf) at 4oC for 10 minutes, and supernatants were
