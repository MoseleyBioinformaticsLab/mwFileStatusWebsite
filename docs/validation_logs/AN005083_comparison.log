Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "Control donor hearts that were considered suitable for transplantation but ultimately not used due to factors such as transport issues, immune mismatches, and size discrepancies between donor and recipient, rather than being post-mortem specimens were collected in this study. These hearts came from individuals who died of non-cardiac reasons and had no risk factors for heart disease, including having a BMI under 30. Following a thorough pathological review, these hearts were confirmed to be structurally normal through histological evaluation. Left ventricular (LV) samples were taken directly in the operating room, immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen at -196째C, and then stored at the Sydney Heart Bank at the University of Sydney, at temperatures ranging from -170 to -180째C. This collection process received the ethical green light from the University of Sydney's Ethics Committee (USYD # 2021/122)."), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "Control donor hearts that were considered suitable for transplantation but ultimately not used due to factors such as transport issues, immune mismatches, and size discrepancies between donor and recipient, rather than being post-mortem specimens were collected in this study.
