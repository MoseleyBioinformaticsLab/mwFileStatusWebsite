Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "The human RPE cell line ARPE-19 (CRL-2302, ATCC) was cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM)/F12 and DMEM high glucose , respectively, with penicillin streptomycin (100 units/ml) and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in a CO2 incubator under 5% (v/v) CO2 at 37°C. Target-specific Silencer® Select siRNAs (Thermo Fischer Scientific) or a Silencer® Select Negative Control No. 1 siRNA (4390843, Thermo Fischer Scientific) were transfected into ARPE-19 with Lipofectamine 3000. Cells were collected once after transfection, re-spread, and collected 3 days later."), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "The human RPE cell line ARPE-19 (CRL-2302, ATCC) was cultured in Dulbecco''s Modified Eagle''s Medium (DMEM)/F12 and DMEM high glucose , respectively, with penicillin streptomycin (100 units/ml) and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in a CO2 incubator under 5% (v/v) CO2 at 37°C.
