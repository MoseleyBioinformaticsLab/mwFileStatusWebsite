Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'Thermal modalities are commonly used in sports medicine to affect tissue healing. Cold therapy is commonly used modalities, but the metabolic changes to muscle after cooling are not known. The objective of this study is to look at the effect of cooling on muscle metabolites and gene expression. There are a total of 8 subjects in the study. Each subject had an ice cup cryotherapy treatment (cool samples) to one leg for 15 minutes, and the other leg served as the control (cntrl samples). Two hours after the application of cryotherapy, a biopsy was taken from each thigh muscle. Muscle was minced with scissors and quickly snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'Thermal modalities are commonly used in sports medicine to affect tissue healing.
