Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', 'Animals were fed for 1 week with diets containing different amounts of Na+ and K+ (n = 7 for each diet; a total of 14 rats). The diets were prepared from K+-deficient powdered rat diet (TD.88239.P.D  Envigo Teklad) with or without supplementation with KCl or NaCl.[10] The control (healthy) diet contained 0.29% Na+, which is the level in normal rat diets, and 2% K+, which is higher than the normal 1%. In the HNaLK diet, Na+ content was increased from 0.29% to 0.79%, a level similar to those in Western diets,[14] and K+ content was decreased to 0.1%, which was selected to be low, but not low enough to deplete plasma K+. The diets were gelled by heating, dissolving 30 g agarose in 500 mL of deionized water, and adding to 500 g of powdered diet supplemented with KCl and NaCl.'), ('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', 'Animals were fed for 1 week with diets containing different amounts of Na+ and K+ (n = 7 for each diet; a total of 14 rats).
