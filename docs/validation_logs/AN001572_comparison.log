Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'Samples were collected by cardiac puncture and plasma was collected following standard centrifugation steps. Immediately following the samples were separated into 500 uL aliquots in 600 uL tubes and frozen in liquid nitrogen.'), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', '"Samples were collected by cardiac puncture and plasma was collected following standard centrifugation steps.

Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', '"We administered normal, high glucose, aspartame, and acesulfame potassium diets to rats for 3 weeks, followed by a plasma collection through cardiac puncture and metabolic analysis (Group 1-4 samples). We also treated the gut microbiota with in rats with the same diets plus bacitracin/streptomycin to observe how alterations of the microbiome influence the plasma metabolic profile in these animals (Groups 5-8). The samples here contain the fructose diet group (Group 9). We also treated the gut microbiota with in rats with the same diets plus bacitracin/streptomycin to observe how alterations of the microbiome influence the plasma metabolic profile in these animals (Groups 5-8). The samples here contain the fructose diet group with antibiotic (Group 10). For the gut microbiota experiment, during the last 10 days of the diet subsets of all groups will have bacitracin and streptomycin (B/S) provided in their drinking water (0.5g/250 mL). The resulting data will give us insights into the influence of high sugar and artificial sweetener diets on homeostatic metabolic processes and dive into the symbiotic relationship of the gut microbiome with this process.
