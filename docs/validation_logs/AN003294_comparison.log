Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', 'Plasmodium falciparum NF54 attB parasites were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium and magnetically enriched to increase the infected to uninfected RBC ratio. Following hemocytometer counts, 1x10^8 parasites were measured per condition into 5 mL of total media for 2.5 hours in the presence of the carbon-13 metabolite (glucose, glutamine, or acetate). Wild-type or WT represents control parasites without additional alterations. Blanks are sample tubes that follow the same procedures as samples following the quenching of metabolism. Both Pool and QC samples are combined samples of all samples from the analytical batch on that particular day. Dates in YYYYMMDD format are appended to individual samples to indicate the batch in which they were processed.'), ('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', 'Plasmodium falciparum NF54 attB parasites were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium and magnetically enriched to increase the infected to uninfected RBC ratio.
