Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'We analyzed hydrolyzed long-chain bases (LCBs) in Huh7 cells treated with a combination of BSA-oleate-d9 and BSA-elaidate-d17. We aimed to confirm the incorporation of oleate and elaidate in the LCB of sphingolipids using their deuterated versions and put them both in direct competition for SPT.'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'We analyzed hydrolyzed long-chain bases (LCBs) in Huh7 cells treated with a combination of BSA-oleate-d9 and BSA-elaidate-d17.'), ('SUBMIT_DATE', '2024-07-26')}
Sections "MS" contain missmatched items: {('MS_COMMENTS', 'Long-chain base (LCB) species were analyzed by multiple reaction monitoring of the transition from precursor to product ions at associated optimized collision energies, and fragmentor voltages using Agilent Masshunter.

Sections "PROJECT" contain missmatched items: {('PROJECT_SUMMARY', 'The goal of the project is to determine the role of sphingolipid metabolism in atherosclerosis induced by dietary trans fat. We analyzed lipid metabolites in Huh7 cells following various fatty acid treatments, with specific focus on cis and trans unsaturated fatty acids. Additionally, we analyzed lipid metabolites in plasma and liver of Ldlr-/- mice fed high-fat diets enriched in cis or trans fatty acids in the presence or absence of myriocin, a pharmacological inhibitor of Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the initial rate-limiting enzyme of sphingolipid biosynthesis.'), ('PROJECT_SUMMARY', 'The goal of the project is to determine the role of sphingolipid metabolism in atherosclerosis induced by dietary trans fat.
