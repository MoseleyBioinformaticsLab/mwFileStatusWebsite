Sections "SAMPLEPREP" contain missmatched items: {('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', "Heart ventricle tissues were harvested from male mice at 2.5 months of age (n = 3 at each condition) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were acquired in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using Agilent QQQ LC-MS systems. Separation of TCA and glycolysis metabolites were performed using 5 mM ammonium acetate in water as buffer pH 9.9 (A), and 100% acetonitrile as buffer (B) using Luna 3 µM NH2 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) and measured 6495 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer via ESI negative mode (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The Gradient used is as follows: 0-20 min-80% B (Flow rate 0.2ml/min); 20-20.10 min- 80% to 2 % B; 20.10-25 min-2% B (Flow rate 0.3ml/min); 25-30 min 80% B (Flowrate 0.35ml/min); 30-35 min-80%B (Flow rate 0.4ml/min); 35-38 min 80% B (Flow rate 0.4ml/min); followed by re-equilibration at the end of the gradient to the initial starting condition 80% B at Flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Separation and measurement of amino acids were performed using Zorbax eclipse XDB C-18, 1.8 micron, 4.6 x 100 mm column on 6495 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer via ESI Positive mode (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Mobile phases A and B were 0.1% formic acid in water and acetonitrile, respectively. The gradient used is as follows: 0 min-2% B; 6 min- 2% of B, 6.5 min-30 % B, 7 min- 90% of B, 12 min 95% of B, 13 min 2% of B followed by re-equilibration at the end of the gradient 20 min to the initial starting condition 2% of B. Flow rate: 0.2 ml/min.

Flow rate: 0.2 ml/min. Separation and measurement of nucleotides were performed using Zorbax eclipse XDB C-18, 1.8 micron, 4.6 x 100 mm column on 6495 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer via ESI Positive mode (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Mobile phases A and B were 0.1% formic acid in water and acetonitrile, respectively. The gradient used is as follows: 0-6 min 2% B, 6-6.50 min 30% B, 7-12 min 95% B, 12-13 min 2% B, and re-equilibration till the end of the gradient 20 min. Flow rate: 0.2 ml/min).
