Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', "All animal work carried was approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of University College Cork and Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) before beginning this study. All experimentation was carried out in accordance with European Directive 2010/63/EU and was approved by both the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of University College Cork (Project Authorization AE19130/P160) and United States Air Force Surgeon General's Office of Research Oversight and Compliance. C57/BL6 mice breeding pairs were acquired from Taconic Biosciences, and F1-generation male and female offspring were used in all experiments. Germ-free, ex-germ-free, and conventional mice were housed 2-4 mice/cage under a 12-hour light/dark cycle and maintained on ad libitum autoclaved water and autoclaved, pelleted diet (Special Diet Services). Housing conditions for germ-free, conventional, and colonized germ-free adhered to the same environmental conditions of temperature (21 ± 1°C) and humidity (55%-60%). Germ-free mice were housed in gnotobiotic flexible-film isolators. Colonized germ-free mice were born and maintained as germ-free mice in gnotobiotic flexible-film isolators until postnatal day 21 when they were removed from the isolators and, for the remaining duration of this study, re-located to the standard animal facility and housed in wire-top cages that contained used-bedding from age- and sex-matched conventional mice. The acute restraint stress procedure was performed using a clean perforated polypropylene screw-cap 50 mL conical tubes. Cages were randomly assigned to either non-stress or stress groups. Each mouse that underwent stress was placed into the 50 mL tube and restrained for 15 minutes."), ('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', "All animal work carried was approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of University College Cork and Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) before beginning this study.
