Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', "Goals - Identify mode of action of Sulforaphane using untargeted metabolomics. Results - Untargeted metabolomics of sulforaphane treated infected cells identified sulforaphane mode of action is via alkylation of parasite thiols especially glutathione. Conclusion - Sulforaphane acts on the parasite via alkylation of parasites''s major antioxidants such as glutathione."), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', "Goals - Identify mode of action of Sulforaphane using untargeted metabolomics.
