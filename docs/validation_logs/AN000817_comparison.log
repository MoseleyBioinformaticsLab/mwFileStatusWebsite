Sections "SAMPLEPREP" contain missmatched items: {('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', 'A total of 6 CHEAR Urine Reference Material aliquots were thawed on ice for sample preparation, 400 \uf06dL of the thawed urine sample were transferred to labeled tubes on ice where they were mixed with 300 \uf06dL of NMR Master Mix solution containing Chenomx ISTD: DSS-d6 and D2O-Phosphate Buffer at 7.4 pH. Sample tubes were vortexed for 2 min on a multi-tube vortexer and centrifuged at 16,000 rcf for 5 min. A 600 \uf06dL of each sample supernatant was transferred into a pre-labeled 5mm 4 NMR tubes for data acquisition on a 700 MHz spectrometer.'), ('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', 'A total of 6 CHEAR Urine Reference Material aliquots were thawed on ice for sample preparation, 400 \uf06dL of the thawed urine sample were transferred to labeled tubes on ice where they were mixed with 300 \uf06dL of NMR Master Mix solution containing Chenomx ISTD: DSS-d6 and D2O-Phosphate Buffer at 7.4 pH.
