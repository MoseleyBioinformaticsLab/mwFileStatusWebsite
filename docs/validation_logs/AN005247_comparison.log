Sections "MS" contain missmatched items: {('MS_COMMENTS', "The mass spectrometer was operated in full scan, positive-ion mode, with the spray voltage set to 3.0 kV, the heated capillary at 275°C, and the HESI probe at 350°C. The sheath gas flow was 40 units, the auxiliary gas flow was 15 units, and the sweep gas flow was 1 unit. MS data was collected in a range of m/z = 200 –1000. The resolution set at 17,500, the AGC target at 3x106, and the maximum injection time at 250 msec. Data acquired by Thermo Fisher''s Xcalibur software and analyzed by their Tracefinder software. The raw files provided contain data from both positive and negative ion mode. The data reported includes the different adducts and reduced forms of the metabolites to show presence or lack thereof."), ('MS_COMMENTS', "The mass spectrometer was operated in full scan, positive-ion mode, with the spray voltage set to 3.0 kV, the heated capillary at 275°C, and the HESI probe at 350°C.
