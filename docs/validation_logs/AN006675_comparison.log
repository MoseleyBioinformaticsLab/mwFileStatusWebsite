Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_METHOD', "Subjects rinsed their mouths vigorously with water for 30 seconds to remove debris, then expectorated. After a two-minute waiting period to establish baseline levels of saliva, the subjects tipped their heads toward the graduated test tubes and expectorated 5mL of whole saliva in the plastic funnel inserted in the plastic, sterile tubes, labeled with the subject's initials, sample name, and date of harvest. The sample was immediately placed on wet ice and transported to the lab. Aprotinin (1mg/ml) and Phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (100 mM in MeOH) were added to the whole saliva at a dilution of 1:100 and 1:200, respectively. The whole saliva was then stored at -80°C until analysis."), ('COLLECTION_METHOD', "Subjects rinsed their mouths vigorously with water for 30 seconds to remove debris, then expectorated.
