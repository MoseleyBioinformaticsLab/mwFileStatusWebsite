Sections "PROJECT" contain missmatched items: {('PROJECT_TITLE', "Bashaga Mongolian medicine anti-liver based on ''intestinal flora-tryptophan metabolism-liver axis'', Study on the mechanism of fiber action"), ('PROJECT_SUMMARY', "Rhododendron molle (Blume) G. Don (abbreviated as RM), known as ''Bashaga'' in traditional Mongolian medicine, was investigated. Mongolian medicine believes that liver fibrosis is caused by the interaction of ''liver-gut'' between blood and heat meridians. ''Bashaga'' is the main Mongolian medicine treatment for liver disease. There is still a lack of modern scientific research to clarify its effectiveness. The source and mechanism of action restrict the clinical development and rational utilization of ''Bashaga''. Preliminary Studies have found that tryptophan metabolic pathway affects the occurrence and development of liver fibrosis. Previous research has shown that Bashaga acts by regulating the ''intestinal microbiota-tryptophan metabolism-liver axis''. This project intends to use a CCL4 induced liver fibrosis rat model, to evaluate the effect of ''Bashaga'' by physiological and biochemical indexes such as pathology, liver injury and inflammatory factors. To study the efficacy of Bahsaga to treat liver fibrosis, the method of combining tryptophan-targeted metabolome with metagenome was used. We explored its regulation of intestinal flora structure, tryptophan metabolites and intestinal barrier by constructing the ''Intestinal flora-tryptophan metabolism-phenotypic function index'' to reveal the anti-hepatic fibrosis effect of Bashaga. The purpose of this study is to clarify the original source and clinical rationality of Bashaga guided by efficacy."), ('PROJECT_SUMMARY', "Rhododendron molle (Blume) G.
