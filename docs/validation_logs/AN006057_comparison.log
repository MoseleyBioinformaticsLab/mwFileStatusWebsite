Cells were immortalised as described in Monticelli et al. 2022 [1] and grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 2\u202fmM glutamine, 0.5\u202fmg/mL penicillin, 0.5\u202fmg/mL streptomycin, and non-essential amino acids at 37\u202f°C in 5% humidified CO2. -/-PMM1 was generated by the insertion of a puromycin resistance cassette into the first exon of PMM1, using the Origene kit KN202004. Following the manufacturer''s instructions, puromycin -up to 0.3 ng/mL- was used for the selection, and resistant cells were analysed via PCR to verify the correct insertion. Positive cells were grown and further analysed via RT-qPCR and immunoblot to confirm the knock-out. For metabolomics analysis, cells from confluent 150 cm2 plates were washed with PBS and enzymatically detached using trypsin, then pelleted in PBS and washed again for 3 times. [1] Monticelli, L.
