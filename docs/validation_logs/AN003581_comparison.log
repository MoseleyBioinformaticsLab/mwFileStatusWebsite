The chromatographic separation was performed by liquid chromatography using XBridge Amide (150 ×\u20092.1mm .D  3.5µm particle size, Waters, USA) analytical column and a binary solvent system with a flow rate of 0.4\u2009ml/min. A guard XBridge Amide column (20 ×\u20092.1mm .D  3.5µm particle size, Waters, USA) was connected in front of analytical column. Mobile phase A was composed of 10 mM ammonium acetate, 10mM ammonium hydroxide containing 5% acetonitrile in LC-MS grade water; mobile phase B was 100% LC-MS grade acetonitrile.'), ('CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY', 'Triple-quadrupole-ion trap hybrid mass spectrometer viz., QTRAP6500+ (Sciex, USA) connected with ultra-performance liquid chromatography I-class (UPLC) system procured from Waters, USA was used for the metabolite analysis.
