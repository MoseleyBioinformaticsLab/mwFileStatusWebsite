Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', '120 mice (equal number of males and females) were randomized into 3 equal groups. One group is on a high-fat Western-style diet (HFWD) alone, a second group is on HFWD supplemented with lanthanides and calcium, and a third control group is supplemented with calcium alone. At study termination (18 months) we will harvest hepatocytes and colonic enterocytes for evaluation of epithelial gene expression patterns. We will also harvest cecal contents and feces for microbial profiling by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing. For this small pilot proposal, we wish to add an untargeted metabolomic analysis component. We will harvest liver (right medial lobe with gall bladder), serum, and feces. We will assay representative liver/gall bladder samples (8 from the HFWD group and 8 from the lanthanide/calcium supplemented group). Remaining liver samples and the serum and feces will be archived for future investigation. Liver is being targeted first since both steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma were seen in our previous study in mice on HFWD. Additionally, alterations of bile acid profiles and bile acid metabolism have been associated with both steatohepatitis and hepatic cancers.'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', '120 mice (equal number of males and females) were randomized into 3 equal groups.
