Five independent cell cultures were measured for each condition and samples were randomised in order to avoid bias in sample analyses due to machine drift. Q Exactive LC-MS/MS vendor raw data files were converted to the open source format mzML using the program ProteoWizard, and then the XCMS program was used for peak alignment, retention time correction and peak area extraction. Significance was determined using an unpaired Student's t-test. p-value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. The acquired spectra were analysed using XCalibur Qual Browser and XCalibur Quan Browser software (Thermo Scientific) by referencing to an internal library of compounds."), ('MS_COMMENTS', 'The Q Exactive mass spectrometer was operated in full MS and polarity switching mode.
