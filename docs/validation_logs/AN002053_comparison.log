Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'Inhibition of immune-checkpoint targets including PD1 is clinically effective in a variety of cancers. However, only a subset of patients respond and complete response remains uncommon. Given the known role of metabolites in modulating immunity, we sought to understand how individual patients’ metabolic activities adapt to PD1 immune checkpoint blockade and how they associate with therapeutic benefits. To this end, we profiled metabolites in pre- and multiple on-treatment patient serum samples from three independent immunotherapy trials using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled with either triple quadrupole MS multiple reaction monitoring or high resolution full scan MS detection. The study consisted of two Phase I trials (CA209-038, NCT01621490; CA209-009, NCT01358721) which included 78 patients with advanced melanoma and 91 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treated with nivolumab. To investigate the generalizability of our results, we also analyzed a large randomized Phase III trial (CheckMate 025, NCT01668784) with 743 RCC patients, among which 394 received nivolumab and 349 received everolimus. V600E is the most common BRAF mutation in melanoma and "BRAF_V600E" indicates the mutation status.'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'Inhibition of immune-checkpoint targets including PD1 is clinically effective in a variety of cancers.
