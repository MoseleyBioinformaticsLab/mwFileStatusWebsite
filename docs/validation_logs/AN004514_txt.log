SCHEMA: Section "CHROMATOGRAPHY" does not match the allowed schema. Wrong key 'SOLVENT_C' in OrderedDict([('CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY', 'The C18 column is operated parallel to the HILIC column for simultaneous analytical separation and column flushing through the use of a dual head HPLC pump equipped with 10-port and 6-port switching valves.
