Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', "Aging-related immune dysfunction is linked to cancer, atherosclerosis, and neurodegenerative diseases. This 6-week randomized controlled trial evaluated whether 2′-fucosyllactose (2′-FL), a human breast milk oligosaccharide with established benefits in infants and animal models, could improve gut microbiota and immune function in 89 healthy older adults (mean age 67.3 years).. While the primary endpoint of cytokine response change wasn't met, 2′-FL supplementation increased gut Bifidobacterium levels and elevated serum insulin, HDL cholesterol, and FGF21 hormone. Bifidobacterium “responders” experienced additional metabolic and proteomic changes and also performed better on a cognitive test of visual memory. Nonresponders were more likely to lack Bifidobacterium in their gut microbiota at the start of the intervention. Multi-omics analysis indicated a systemic response to 2′-FL, which could be detected in blood and urine, showcasing the potential of this prebiotic to provide diverse benefits for healthy aging. Trial registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03690999). We found three metabolites that had statistically significant interaction effects in our LME modeling: octanoylcarnitine, glutamate and taurine (P = 0.0011, P = 0.042, P = 0.049, respectively, LME, Benjamini-Hochberg corrected, Table S5). Octanoylcarnitine is a medium-chain fatty acid covalently linked to carnitine which undergoes fatty acid oxidation in the mitochondria. Post hoc analysis revealed that octanoylcarnitine decreased significantly in the High Dose 2′-FL group during the intervention (P = 0.015, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Figure 4A), but not in the Low Dose 2′-FL group or Placebo group (P = 0.27, P = 0.39, respectively, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Glutamate and taurine significantly increased in abundance in the Placebo group during the intervention (P = 0.028 for glutamate, P = 0.003 for taurine, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests). Levels of these metabolites also increased in the Low Dose 2′-FL (P = 0.14 for glutamate, P = 0.10 for taurine, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests) and High Dose 2′-FL groups (P = 0.12 for glutamate, P = 0.13 for taurine, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests), albeit not in a statistically significant manner."), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', "Aging-related immune dysfunction is linked to cancer, atherosclerosis, and neurodegenerative diseases.
