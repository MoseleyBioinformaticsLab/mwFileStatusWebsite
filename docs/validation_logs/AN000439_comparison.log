In this study, the ability of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) to induce myofibroblast differentiation was analyzed in isolated human lung fibroblasts, and its in vivo significance was evaluated in rodent bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The results showed that SHH could induce myofibroblast differentiation in human lung fibroblasts in a Smo- and Gli1-dependent manner. Gel shift analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that a Gli1 binding consensus in the ?-SMA gene promoter was important for mediating SHH-induced myofibroblast differentiation. Analysis of Hedgehog reemergence in vivo revealed that of all three Hedgehog isoforms, only SHH was significantly induced in bleomycin-injured lung along with Gli1. The induction of SHH was only noted in epithelial cells, and its expression was undetectable in lung fibroblasts or macrophages. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-? induced SHH significantly in cultured alveolar epithelial cells, whereas SHH induced TGF-? in lung fibroblasts. Pulmonary fibrosis and ?-smooth muscle actin (?-SMA) expression were significantly reduced in mice that were Smo deficient only in type I collagenexpressing cells. Thus, the reemergence of SHH in epithelial cells could result in induction of myofibroblast differentiation in a Smo-dependent manner and subsequent Gli1 activation of the ?-SMA promoter.'), ('PROJECT_SUMMARY', 'Hedgehog signaling plays important roles in cell development and differentiation.
