Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'Root VOCs and soil VOCs were trapped as described here (Schulz-Bohm, et al, 2018, "Calling from distance: attraction of soil bacteria by plant root volatiles", The ISME Journal, 12(5), pp.1252-1262.). Briefly, 1 Tenax cartridge was fitted into the side arms of the glass pots in such a way that their opening was exposed toward the plant roots/soil. The other arm received a constant airflow from an aerator. VOCs were sampled for 40 hours and immediately analyzed by thermal desorption-gas chromatography‒mass spectrometry.'), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'Root VOCs and soil VOCs were trapped as described here (Schulz-Bohm, et al, 2018, Calling from distance: attraction of soil bacteria by plant root volatiles, The ISME Journal, 12(5), pp.1252-1262.).
