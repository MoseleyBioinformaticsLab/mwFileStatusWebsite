Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', "After Pnpla6fl/flCAG-CreER (+) and Pnpla6fl/flCAG-CreER (-) were euthanized by cervical dislocation, the eyes were isolated, periocular connective tissue was removed, and the optic nerve was isolated. The cornea was separated at the corneal ring using a Vannas shear (and then the iris and lens were removed. An intact RPE sheet was removed from the underlying Bruch''s membrane using a microsurgical crescent knife under a dissecting microscope."), ('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', "After Pnpla6fl/flCAG-CreER (+) and Pnpla6fl/flCAG-CreER (-) were euthanized by cervical dislocation, the eyes were isolated, periocular connective tissue was removed, and the optic nerve was isolated.
