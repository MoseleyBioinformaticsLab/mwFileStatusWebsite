After the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000g at 4° C, the supernatant A was collected and saved, and the pellets were submitted to re-extraction following the same procedure to generate supernatant B. Supernatant A and B were mixed and transferred to a clean 1.5 mL microtube with the appropriated volume of 15% NH4CO3. The samples were stored in a -80° C freezer until analysis by LC-MS. For Plasma: To extract polar metabolites from mouse plasma 40 µL of cold methanol was added to a 15 µL of mouse plasma in a 1.5 mL microtube. This mixture was vortexed for 10 seconds and incubated for 20 minutes in a -20° C freezer. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000g at 4° C. Next, supernatant A was collected in a new tube, and the pellet was saved for re-extraction. For re-extraction, the pellet was resuspended in 200 µL of 40:40:20 buffer, vortexed, and allowed to sit on ice for 10 min. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 g at 4° C.

Using in vivo (GEMMs), we characterized the metabolic profile of NSCLC harboring this mutation compared to controls. Here, we show that PolG mutation causes mitochondrial dysfunction, impacting serine/glycine metabolism as well as energy metabolism through glycolysis. This study was conducted in animals divided into two age groups. The young group consisted of animals in which NSCLC was initiated at 3 months of age, while the old group included animals whose tumors were initiated at 10 months of age.
