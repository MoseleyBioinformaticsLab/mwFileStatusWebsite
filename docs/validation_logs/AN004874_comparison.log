Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'In general, bulbs of Corydalis yanhusuo can be divided into "mother-bulb (MB)" and "son-bulb (SB)" according to different parts. The mother bulbs are formed by the degeneration and re-expansion of their original stem and are used as medicinal material in production. Son bulbs emerge from axillary buds on horizontally elongated rhizomes, of which the larger bulb can also be used as medicine, while the smaller bulb is reserved as a seed stem for "seed". In this study, materials of C. yanhusuo bulbs were cultivated in the field, which was proposed and identified by Professor Da-xia Chen. Widely targeted metabolome sequencing of C. yanhusuo bulbs was performed by UPLC-ESI MS/MS system, and its metabolites were successfully identified and annotated in self-built database (the MetWare database). A total of 702 metabolites were identified in all samples, including 216 alkaloids, 120 lipids, 67 amino acids and their derivatives, 59 organic acids, 63 phenolic acids, 19 terpenoids, 28 flavonoids, 4 lignin and coumarins, 43 nucleotides and their derivatives, 1 tannin, 3 quinones and 79 other substances. The numbers of up-accumulated and down-accumulated metabolites in MB-A vs MB-C and SB-A vs SB-C were 135 and 148, 90 and 210, respectively. There were 184 kinds of DAMs between SB-A and MB-A (including 144 down-accumulated and 40 up-accumulated compounds in the MB-A samples) and 127 kinds of DAMs between SB-C and MB-C (including 57 down-accumulated and 40 up-accumulated compounds in the MB-C samples) .'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'In general, bulbs of Corydalis yanhusuo can be divided into mother-bulb (MB) and son-bulb (SB) according to different parts.
