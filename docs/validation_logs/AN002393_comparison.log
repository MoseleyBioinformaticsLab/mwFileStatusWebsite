Sections "SAMPLEPREP" contain missmatched items: {('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', '500 L of ice-cold extraction solvent (1:1 v/v ACN/water) containing 10 M of d5-benzoic acid as internal standard (IS) was added to 250 mg of wet stool sample and subjected to vortex mixing for 5 min at ambient temperature (24 ± 1 ◦C). The ratio of extraction solvent to wet sample weight was kept constant (2 L:1 mg) to prevent variable extraction efficiencies. The suspension was then centrifuged at 18 000g for 10 min at 4 ◦C. The supernatant was carefully removed and centrifuged again at 18 000g for 10 min at 4 ◦C. An aliquot of 100 L was subsequently derivatized using a final concentration of 10 mM aniline and 5 mM EDC for 2 h at 4 ◦C. The derivatization reaction was quenched using a final concentration of 18 mM succinic acid and 4.6 mM 2-mercaptoethanol for 2 h at 4 ◦C. An aliquot of each sample was further diluted 100-fold. All samples were stored at 4 ◦C until analysis on the same day'), ('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', '500 \x04L of ice-cold extraction solvent (1:1 v/v ACN/water) containing 10 \x04M of d5-benzoic acid as internal standard (IS) was added to 250 mg of wet stool sample and subjected to vortex mixing for 5 min at ambient temperature (24 ± 1 ◦C).
