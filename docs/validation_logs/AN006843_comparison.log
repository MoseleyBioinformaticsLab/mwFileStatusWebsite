Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', 'BMDMs were infected with Mtb at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 2, post which the cells were divided into different treatment groups. They were either treated for 24 hours with vehicle control (0.2% DMSO), 10 μM UK5099, 20 μM Meclizine hydrochloride, 10 mM glucose or 10 mM galactose. During the treatment, cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2. Post treatment, cells were scraped off and prepared for analysis as described in the "Sample prep" section.'), ('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', 'BMDMs were infected with Mtb at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 2, post which the cells were divided into different treatment groups.

Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'Bone marrow of female C57BL/6 mice were isolated from the long bones of the legs, femur and tibia. The entire marrow was incubated for 6 days in culture medium- DMEM+10%FBS+2 mM glutamine+10 mM HEPES+1 mM sodium pyruvate+30 ng/ml macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) to differentiate monocytes into macrophages. Post 6 days, the attached cells were kept, and the supernatant was washed off. These cells were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis at an moi of 2 for 3 hours and 24 hours post infection kept under different treatment conditions described in the next section. During the entirety of the experiment, the cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Post-treatment, the cells were scraped off in 80% ethanol, heated at 80°C for 90 seconds, vortexed and heated again for 90 seconds at 80°C. Post heating, they were immediately transferred to an ice bath for 5 minutes.Post that,the cells were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 5 minutes with the temperature maintained at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, lyophilised and stored at -80 °C until further analysis described in Sample prep.Post-treatment, the cells were scraped off in 80% ethanol, heated at 80 °C for 90 seconds, vortexed and heated again for 90 seconds at 80 °C.
