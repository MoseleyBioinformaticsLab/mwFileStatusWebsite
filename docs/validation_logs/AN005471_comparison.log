Sections "PROJECT" contain missmatched items: {('PROJECT_SUMMARY', "In lung transplantation (LuTx), various ischemic phases exist, yet the rewarming ischemia time (RIT) during implantation has often been overlooked. During RIT, lungs are deflated and exposed to the body temperature in the recipient''s chest cavity. Our prior clinical findings demonstrated that prolonged RIT increases the risk of primary graft dysfunction. However, the molecular mechanisms of rewarming ischemic injury in this context remain unexplored.
