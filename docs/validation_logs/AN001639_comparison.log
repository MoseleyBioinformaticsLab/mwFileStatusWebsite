Sections "PROJECT" contain missmatched items: {('PROJECT_SUMMARY', '"Although the effectiveness of several therapeutic interventions depend critically on their timing with respect to circadian phase, including the timing of light therapy for circadian rhythm sleep disorders, medications for high blood pressure, and chemotherapy treatments for cancer, no clinical test is available to reliably measure circadian phase rapidly, inexpensively, and non-invasively. This project will therefore provide the essential first steps toward the development and validation of a clinical test to estimate circadian phase from a single urine void via the identification of multiple rhythmic metabolites in urine using untargeted metabolomic profiling methods. Current methods to assess circadian phase in urine require serial measurement of a single compound (e.g., 6-sulphatoxymelatonin, the urinary metabolite of melatonin) over a 24- to 48-hour sampling window. Our approach proposes to assess many compounds in one sample to estimate circadian phase, based on the phase relationships across multiple parameters, an approach that is supported by our theoretical modeling framework. Using the untargeted metabolomics profiling services offered by the Mayo Clinic Metabolomics Resource Core, we will examine the 48-hour profiles of ~300 metabolites identified from urine samples collected in a randomly selected pilot sample of 12 healthy young volunteers (from >200 subjects) studied on an inpatient laboratory protocol that included both an ambulatory condition (i.e., habitual sleep-wake times under ordinary room light) and a constant routine procedure, the gold standard method for assessing circadian rhythms (i.e., 50-hour period during which subjects remain awake in a semi-recumbent posture in bed under dim light with equicaloric snacks served hourly). Cosinor analysis will be employed to determine which identified metabolites exhibit circadian rhythmicity, and comparisons between ambulatory and constantroutine conditions will further identify which metabolites are influenced by external factors such as sleep, meal timing, light, and posture. Finally, we will employ our theoretical modeling framework to estimate circadian phase from a single urine void using the concentration ratios of multiple metabolites that exhibit reliable and robust circadian rhythmicity. The accuracy of estimated circadian phase will be determined by comparison to actual circadian phase as defined by the peak of the 6-sulphatoxymelatonin rhythm. Once this approach has been established in a pilot set of subjects, future studies will focus on validation and testing of this approach in other data from our repository, including healthy young volunteers who have undergone rapid phase shift due to changes in sleep-wake schedule (i.e., simulated shift work) or in response to bright light exposure; patients with insomnia, who exhibit an 8-hour range in circadian phase; and blind participants without light perception, who exhibit non-entrained rhythms. Future studies will also test the efficacy of this method to a priori estimate circadian phase in patient populations that may benefit from improvements in circadian timing of treatment. The current proposal therefore represents the first essential step in developing a tool that can revolutionize medicine by adding an accurate measure of internal time – circadian medicine – into standard clinical practice.'), ('PROJECT_SUMMARY', 'Although the effectiveness of several therapeutic interventions depend critically on their timing with respect to circadian phase, including the timing of light therapy for circadian rhythm sleep disorders, medications for high blood pressure, and chemotherapy treatments for cancer, no clinical test is available to reliably measure circadian phase rapidly, inexpensively, and non-invasively.

Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'Serial urine samples were collected at each void (approximately every 3 hours) from subjects during a 6-day inpatient protocol. The total volume of each sample was measured, and then 5 mL was aliquoted into a 7 mL tube and elivered on ice to the processing lab, where the samples were then stored at either -20 degrees or -80 degrees (see details below). At the end of the study, samples were transported (~2 blocks) from the processing lab to our -20 or -80 freezer for storage. The samples being sent represent samples from two female subjects (3634A and 3635A) and one male subject (3624A). These subjects all spent 6 days in the lab: 3 baseline days where the subjects slept for 8 hours at night (at habitual times as determined during the screening period) and 16 hours of ambulatory wake in ambient light, followed by 50 hours of continuous wakefulness in which the subject was kept in a semi-recumbent position in bed under dim light and fed hourly isocaloric snacks (called a "constant routine"). We are requesting untargeted profiling of samples from these subjects (plus 6-sulphatoxymelatonin profile) to determine how the concentrations of different metabolites vary across the 24-hour period, and specifically to compare this circadian variation in each metabolite during a 48-hour ambulatory period versus a 48-hour constant routine period.'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'Serial urine samples were collected at each void (approximately every 3 hours) from subjects during a 6-day inpatient protocol.
