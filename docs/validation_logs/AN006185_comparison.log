Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', "Edible grass (Rumex patientia L.× Rumex tianschanicus A. LOS), a perennial herbaceous plant from the Polygonaceae family, boasts a high protein content and rapid growth rate, making it a promising solution to feed shortages as a forage protein source. In this study, we utilized the PacBio sequencing platform and integrated methods including Hi-C to achieve a chromosomal-scale assembly of the R. patientia genome. The assembled genome spans 2.19 Gb with an N50 of 18.84 Mb, and 93.61% (2.05 Gb) of the assembly has been allocated to 30 pseudochromosomes. Comparative genomic analysis has revealed significant expansion of gene families involved in nitrogen metabolism and D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism pathways, which are responsible for the plant''s strong nitrogen utilization capabilities and high protein content. Additionally, expansions in gene families associated with the Wnt signaling pathway, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, Toll and Imd signaling pathways, TGF-β signaling pathway, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, photosynthesis-antenna proteins, circadian rhythm, and cell cycle pathways are closely related to the rapid growth and development of R. patientia. We have also identified the rhizosphere microbiome of R. patientia and, by integrating metabolomic data from root tissues and soil, found that during rapid growth phases, the plant secretes various apigenin-like compounds into the soil, enhancing the symbiotic nitrogen-fixing capabilities and potentially providing nitrogen sources to the leaves through symbiotic nitrogen fixation.
