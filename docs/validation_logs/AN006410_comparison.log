Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "Human normal fibroblasts (TIG-3, JCRB0506) was obtained from the JCRB cell bank. Cells used in this experiment were grown in Dulbecco''s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Nacalai Tesque, 16971-55) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, 10437-028) and penicillin/streptomycin (Fujifilm Wako Chemicals, 168-23191). For induction of cellular senescence by X-irradiation, TIG-3 cells were seeded at a density of 2500 cells/cm2 and cultured for 11 days after irradiating TIG-3 cells with 15 Gy of X-rays using CP-160 (Faxitron X-ray Corporation)."), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "Human normal fibroblasts (TIG-3, JCRB0506) was obtained from the JCRB cell bank.
