Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', "Coral fragments of Galaxea fascicularis (stony coral) and Clavularia inflata (soft coral) were subjected to an acute heat stress experiment. After a 3-day acclimation period at 27\u202f°C, the temperature in the heat treatment group was gradually raised from 27\u202f°C to 33\u202f°C over 2 hours and then maintained at 33\u202f°C for 72 hours. The control group was continuously kept at 27\u202f°C throughout the experiment. Temperature was monitored every 15 minutes using a data logger to ensure precise thermal conditions. This setup simulated short-term heatwave events to evaluate the corals' thermal stress responses under controlled conditions."), ('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', "Coral fragments of Galaxea fascicularis (stony coral) and Clavularia inflata (soft coral) were subjected to an acute heat stress experiment.
