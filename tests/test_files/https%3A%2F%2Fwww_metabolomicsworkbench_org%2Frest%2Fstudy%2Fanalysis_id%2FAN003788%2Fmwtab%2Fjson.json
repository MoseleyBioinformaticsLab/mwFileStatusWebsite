"PROJECT":{"PROJECT_TITLE":"13C NMR metabolomics: integrating J-resolved STOCSY and INADEQUATE","PROJECT_SUMMARY":"Robust annotation of metabolites remains a challenging task in metabolomics. This study introduces an approach that uses 13C homonuclear J-resolved experiment (JRES), statistical total correlation spectroscopy (STOCSY), and 2D incredible natural abundance double-quantum experiment (INADEQUATE) complementarily, to obtain robust molecular structure information based on 13C NMR with less experiment time. This approach was tested using the endometabolome from a model marine phytoplankton strain, varying the settings of incubation temperature, nutrient condition, and the presence of co-culturing bacteria.","INSTITUTE":"University of Georgia","LAST_NAME":"Uchimiya","FIRST_NAME":"Mario","ADDRESS":"315 Riverbend Rd, Athens, GA, 30602, USA","EMAIL":"mario.uchimiya@uga.edu","PHONE":"(706) 542-8387","FUNDING_SOURCE":"NSF (grant numbers 1948104, OCE-2019589, and 1946970), NIH (5R01GM120151-04)","CONTRIBUTORS":"Edison Lab, Moran Lab"},

"COLLECTION":{"COLLECTION_SUMMARY":"320 mL of diatom cells were collected by filtering the culture onto 2.0-µm-pore-size PCTE membrane filters (MilliporeSigma Isopore).

"TREATMENT":{"TREATMENT_SUMMARY":"Six treatments of a marine diatom strain Thalassiosira pseudonana CCMP1335 were prepared: treatments incubated axenically at either 14, 20, or 28 oC, and treatments co-cultured with a bacterial strain Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3 at the corresponding temperatures (four replicates for each). L1 media was used with NaH13CO3 as a source of bicarbonate. The diatom used for the co-cultured treatments was B12 stressed to emphasize the known co-existing system. The light cycle consisted of 16 h light (120 µmol photons m-2 s-1) and 8 h of dark.","TREATMENT_PROTOCOL_FILENAME":"3_Treatment protocol__UGA_phytoplankton_Oct2022.docx"},

"SAMPLEPREP":{"SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY":"Phytoplankton cells were removed from filters using a sonicator SLPe (Branson) in ultra-pure water (Millipore), concentrated by a lyophilizer (Labconco), and kept -80oC until further processing. The samples were mixed with 600 µL of 30 mmol L-1 sodium phosphate buffer (18 mmol L-1 NaHPO4, 12 mmol L-1, pH 7.4) and an internal standard of 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate-d6 (DSS, 1 mmol L-1), vortexed at 4oC for 5 minutes, centrifuged at 20,800 rcf using an ultracentrifuge 5417C (Eppendorf) at 4oC for 10 minutes, and supernatants were transferred to 5-mm NMR tubes (NORELL).","SAMPLEPREP_PROTOCOL_FILENAME":"4_Sample preparation protocol__UGA_phytoplankton_Oct2022.docx"},
