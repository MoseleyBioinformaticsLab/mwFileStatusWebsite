Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', "Serum, cecal content, cecum tissue samples of murine, chow diet, and T.mu cells were collected to perform the targeted free fatty acids metabolome analysis. The aim of this study was to verify that whether T.mu could release free PUFA (especially ARA) to the intestinal tract of its host by comparing the PUFA concentration in the freshly isolated T.mu cells, chow diet, cecal content and serum of the host (Mus musculus).Based on the result of this targeted free fatty acids metabolomics studies, we found that T.mu could release ARA to the intestinal tract of its host and increase the concentration of ARA in its host's intestinal tract."), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', "Serum, cecal content, cecum tissue samples of murine, chow diet, and T.mu cells were collected to perform the targeted free fatty acids metabolome analysis.
