Sections "MS" contain missmatched items: {('MS_COMMENTS', 'LIT and triple quadrupole (QQQ) scans were acquired in both positive and negative ion modes under the control of Analyst 1.6.3 software (Sciex, Washington, USA). The ion spray voltage (IS) of the ESI source was 5500 and -4500 V for positive and negative modes, respectively. Source temperature was set at 500 C, ion source gas I (GSI), gas II (GSII), curtain gas (CUR) at 55, 60, and 25.0 psi, respectively, and collision gas (CAD) high. Instrument tuning and mass calibration in QQQ and LIT modes were performed with 10 and 100 μmol/L polypropylene glycol solutions, respectively. Specific sets of multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions of various periods of retention time were monitored according to an in-house library of metabolites.'), ('MS_COMMENTS', 'LIT and triple quadrupole (QQQ) scans were acquired in both positive and negative ion modes under the control of Analyst 1.6.3 software (Sciex, Washington, USA).
