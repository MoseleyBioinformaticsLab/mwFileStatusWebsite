Sections "PROJECT" contain missmatched items: {('PROJECT_SUMMARY', "We demonstrate that SIRT3 knockdown induces mitochondrial dysfunction-associated senescence (MiDAS) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Mechanistically, hyperacetylation of SLC25A13—a SIRT3 substrate—compromises its function, leading to a reduced cytosolic NAD+/NADH ratio and subsequent senescence. Furthermore, employing a 'hit-and-run' screening strategy, we identified senolytic agents capable of selectively eliminating senescent tumor cells, providing potential therapeutic avenues for CRC treatment"), ('PROJECT_SUMMARY', "We demonstrate that SIRT3 knockdown induces mitochondrial dysfunction-associated senescence (MiDAS) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells.
