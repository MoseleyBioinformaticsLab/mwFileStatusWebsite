Sections "SAMPLEPREP" contain missmatched items: {('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', 'De-identified samples were shipped to the NIH RTI-RCMRC on dry ice and immediately stored at -80 °C after being logged in for metabolomics analysis. Study samples were thawed on ice for sample preparation. A 150 µL aliquot of plasma was transferred to new labeled tubes for each study sample. A total study pool was generated by transferring 15 µL of plasma from each sample into a new 10 mL Falcon tube. The total pool sample was vortexed and 150 µL aliquots were transferred into 10 total pool-labeled tubes. Plasma and pooled samples were extracted with 450 µL methanol, vortexed for 2 min on a multi-tube vortexer, and centrifuged at 16,000 rcf for 5 min. A 400 µl aliquot of the supernatant was transferred into pre-labeled 2.0mL LoBind Eppendorf tubes, and the supernatant was lyophilized to complete dryness overnight. Samples were reconstituted with 250 µL of NMR master mix solution containing Chenomx ISTD: DSS-d6 and 0.20 M phosphate buffer at 7.4 pH. The tubes were vortexed for 2 min on a multi-tube vortexer and centrifuged at 16,000 rcf for 5 min.
