Sections "MS" contain missmatched items: {('MS_COMMENTS', 'Following chromatography the sample underwent electrospray ionization on an Agilent Revident ESI-QTOF. Dry gas temperature was set to 300 °C, gas flow 3.5 L/min, nebulizer pressure 35 psi, and capillary voltage of 3500 V. Ions were detected in negative mode (m/z range: 50 – 1700). Internal calibrants 62.032683 and 983.035752 were infused continuously. Data are reported in units of AUC per CFU (colony forming units} per mL'), ('MS_COMMENTS', 'Following chromatography the sample underwent electrospray ionization on an Agilent Revident ESI-QTOF.
