Sections "PROJECT" contain missmatched items: {('PROJECT_SUMMARY', 'Metabolomics holds the promise to measure and quantify small molecules comprehensively in biological systems, and LC-MS (liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrometry) has become the leading technology in the field. Significant challenges still exist in the computational processing of data from LC-MS metabolomic experiments into metabolite features, including provenance and reproducibility of the current software tools. We present here, an experiment designed as serial mixtures of vegetable juice/Water and human plasma at varying ratios, nicknamed “Bloody Mary 21(BM21)" to test semi-quantification at –omics scale. A subset of features are expected to have their peak areas correlated with the mixing ratio. This dataset provides an opportunity to be used as benchmark to assess the performance in quantification of processing softwares.'), ('PROJECT_SUMMARY', 'Metabolomics holds the promise to measure and quantify small molecules comprehensively in biological systems, and LC-MS (liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrometry) has become the leading technology in the field.
