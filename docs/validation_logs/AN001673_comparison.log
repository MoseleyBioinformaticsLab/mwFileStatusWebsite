Sections "SAMPLEPREP" contain missmatched items: {('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', '"large scale profiling of rat cerebral spinal fluid The brain tissue and CSF will be collected for mass spectrometry. To prepare samples, proteins will be removed from collected dialysates by adding cold methanol:water (8:1, v/v) mixture containing 5.0 μg internal standard (IS), myristic-d27 acid, at ambient temperature. Samples will be vortexed for 1 min, incubated on ice for 15 min, and then centrifuged. The supernatant will be completely dried in a SpeedVac, and the lyophilized sample will be subsequently methoxiaminated using 20 μl of a 20 mg/ml solution of methoxyamine hydrochloride in pyridine at 30°C for 90 min and derivatized using 80 μL of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide with 1% trimethylchloro-silane (MSTFA + 1% TMCS, Pierce) at 37°C for 30 min."'), ('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', 'large scale profiling of rat cerebral spinal fluid The brain tissue and CSF will be collected for mass spectrometry.

Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', '"Rats will either be controls, injected with saline, or injected with ferrous chloride to influence PTE. Trauma-Induced Epilepsy Model: Ferrous chloride injection model: Ferrous chloride solution (5 μl of 100 mM with saline) will be injected at a rate of 0.5 μl/min through a Hamilton micro-syringe controlled by a micro-pump (UMP3, WPI, FL). Once the ferrous chloride solution injection is completed, the syringe will remain in position for 5 minutes, and then it will be removed slowly. The burr holes will be closed with light-curing dental cement. The dose of ferrous chloride injection was determined from prior published reports from mouse, rat, and cat. They all used 100 mM ferrous chloride aqueous solution and volumes were various: 1 μl for mouse,14 5 μl for rat (200-300 g),15 and 10 μl for cat (2-4 Kg).15 Video monitoring: The use of 24 x 7 video monitoring and review means that we do not have to rely on the rats having seizures during daily rounding or at some other time when a human happens to be present in the home cage. Normally, the video will be watched in time lapse, fast-forward mode to scan for potential seizures. The reviewer can then stop the video, rewind and watch the behavioral episode in real-time or slow motion to determine whether a seizure actually occurred. Behavioral seizures will be identified by any combination or sequence of the following: loss of postural control (opisthotonus), tonic flexion or extension of limbs or head/neck, and clonic movements of limbs or head/neck. Often, behavioral seizures in rats may be accompanied by drooling, urination and facial twitches, although these may not always be observable on video. In addition, seizures will likely be followed by a postictal phase, which may include a period of running, jumping and general agitation. Video monitoring cannot detect subclinical or electrographic seizures (i.e., seizures without a behavioral component). Video will be reviewed in this way for each rat in order to establish that a cortical injured rat does indeed have epilepsy, to establish the “typical seizure” pattern in each rat, and to help establish a seizure frequency baseline, although it is understood that video monitoring alone might occasionally miss a seizure. EEG monitoring: To prevent imaging distortion and ferromagnetic interference, graphite carbon electrodes will be fabricated and/or purchased. A total of five electrodes will be implanted for EEG monitoring on the skull. EEG will be monitored with the Open EPhys System.18 While EEG recording, EEG electrodes will be connected to wires attached to the ceiling of a cage. In trauma-induced epilepsy rats, spontaneous neural activity will be recorded using a wide bandwidth (0-9 kHz) recording system.
