Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'Chlorido[N,N’-disalicylidene-1,2-phenylenediamine]iron(III) complexes (SCs) exhibit potent anti-cancer properties through incompletely understood molecular mechanisms. Here, we treated human MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells with the glutathione peroxidase (GPX)4 inhibitor RSL3 or chlorido[N,N’-disalicylidene-1,2-phenylenediamine]iron(III) complexes (SCs) and analyzed their oxidized phospholipid profile by targeted lipidomics. SCs induce extensive (hydroper)oxidation of arachidonic acid and adrenic acid in membrane phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) and phosphatidylinositols (PC). In this process, SCs have demonstrated superior efficacy compared to the GPX4 inhibitor RSL3, an established ferroptosis inducer. Please note that one sample set was measured three times with the same sample-ID, but with different methods (oxPE, oxPC, oxPI), therefore each sub-class has their own raw-data file marked by their corresponding abbreviation (oxPE, oxPC, oxPI; e.g. 210309_MDA_Timecourse_RSL3_oxPE_dil_UD_Std_1ul_SFT.wiff, 210324_Rescue_Gust_compounds_oxPE_dil_UD_std_1ul_SFT.wiff, 210309_MDA_Timecourse_RSL3_oxPC_dil_UD_Std_1ul_SFT.wiff, 210324_Rescue_Gust_compounds_oxPC_dil_UD_std_1ul_SFT.wiff or 210324_Rescue_Gust_compounds_oxPI_dil_UD_std_1ul_SFT.wiff, ).'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'Chlorido[N,N’-disalicylidene-1,2-phenylenediamine]iron(III) complexes (SCs) exhibit potent anti-cancer properties through incompletely understood molecular mechanisms.
