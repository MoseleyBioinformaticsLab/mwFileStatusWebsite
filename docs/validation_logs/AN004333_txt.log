SCHEMA: Section "ANALYSIS" does not match the allowed schema. Wrong key 'ANALYSIS_COMMENTS:' in OrderedDict([('ANALYSIS_TYPE', 'MS'), ('ANALYSIS_COMMENTS:', 'Ion ratios of endogenous acyl CoAs to the C-17 CoA internal standard are computed from centroided spectra using a software package NeoLynx (Waters, Milford, MA). The ratios are converted to concentrations using calibrators prepared by spiking tissue homogenates with authentic CoAs (Sigma, St. Louis , MO) having saturated acyl chain lengths C0- C18. Corrections for the heavy isotope effects, mainly 13C, to the adjacent m+2 spectral peaks in a particular chain length cluster are made empirically by referring to the observed spectra for the analytical standards. The values are expressed in pmol/mg.')])
