Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', "C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in Dulbecco''s modified Eagle''s medium (DMEM, Corning, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Corning, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (PS, Hyclone, USA) for cell growth and maintenance. The medium was changed periodically to ensure optimal cell health. To prepare low-glucose DMEM (0.5 g/L D-glucose, without sodium pyruvate), we mixed standard DMEM (4.5 g/L D-glucose, without sodium pyruvate, Corning, USA) with sugar-free DMEM (without sodium pyruvate, Corning, USA) in a ratio of 1:8. This was followed by the addition of 10% FBS to create the conditions necessary to model myoblasts and myotubes, respectively, under low-glucose conditions. Sodium (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (Sigma-Aldrich, China) was added to the medium."), ('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', "C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Corning, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Corning, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (PS, Hyclone, USA) for cell growth and maintenance.
