Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', "Cells were grown to full confluence and held for 3-days in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). 24 hours prior to infection, cells were starved of serum in DMEM lacking FBS.

Lipid-free BSA carrier protein (Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 1.7 µM to conjugate d5-LPC(17:0) prior to each experiment. 1 hpi, 10uM LPC(17:0)isotopic tracer or vehicle EtOH was fed to cells in serum-free growth medium.
