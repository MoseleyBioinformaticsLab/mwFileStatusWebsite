Sections "SAMPLEPREP" contain missmatched items: {('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', 'Leaf samples with approximately 50 mg were collected for the metabolomics analysis; four replicates per plant. After harvesting, samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C until metabolites extraction and analysis. Each sample was ground in a ball mill (Biospec Products, USA) before solvent extraction. Metabolites were extracted using an adapted protocol from The Max Planck Institute, called All-in-One, which provides a polar fraction for secondary metabolite analysis, a nonpolar fraction for lipidomics, and a protein pellet for proteomics; all obtained from the same plant sample. Each ground sample was added to a microtube and mixed with 1 mL of a methanol and methyl-tert-butyl-ether (1:3) solution at − 20°C. After homogenization, they were incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. Each microtube was ultrasonicated in an ice bath for another 10 min. Then, 500 μL of a methanol and water (1:3) solution was added to the microtube before centrifugation (12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min). Three phases were separate: an upper non-polar (green), a lower polar (brown), and a remaining protein pellet. Samples were transferred to fresh microtubes and vacuum-dried in a speed vac (Centrivap, Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA) overnight at room temperature (~ 22 °C).'), ('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', 'Leaf samples with approximately 50 mg were collected for the metabolomics analysis; four replicates per plant.
