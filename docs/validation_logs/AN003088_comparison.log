Sections "MS" contain missmatched items: {('MS_COMMENTS', 'MS acquisition: The LC/MS platform consisted of a 1290 Infinity II UHPLC coupled to a 6545 QTOF mass spectrometer via Dual AJS ESI source (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) and was controlled using MassHunter data acquisition software (v.10.1). Assessment of MS instrument performance and usage of reference ions were also performed as described previously. Full scan MS data (m/z 50-1700) was acquired at a scan rate of 2.5 spectra/sec (equals 3224 transients/spectrum) with the following source conditions: Gas temperature 250째C, gas flow 13 L/min, sheath gas temperature and flow at 400째C and 12 L/min, respectively, nebulizer 30 psi, fragmentor 135, capillary voltage at +4500 V and -4000 V, nozzle voltage was zero. Data processing: Positive and negative mode data was analysed separately. Data files (30 sample files, 6 QC files and 3 tube blank extraction files) were loaded into MassHunter Profinder (v 10 SP1, Agilent) and assigned to sample groups. Spectral feature extraction was performed using the recursive feature extraction method employing default settings with minor adjustments: Peak extraction was restricted to retention time (Rt) range 0-6.5 min, compound binning and alignment tolerances were set to 1% + 0.3 min for Rt and 20 ppm + 2 mDa for mass, integrator Agile 2 was used for peak integration, peak filters were set to at least 2500 counts and features must have satisfied filter conditions in at least 75 % of files in at least one sample group. Feature peak area was exported and data cleaning was performed using an in-house R script compiled of the following steps. Features were deleted if they: had a mean QC/tube blank area ratio of &lt; 10; were absent across all QC samples; and had duplicates present. In addition, samples with a TIC scaling factor more than 50% above or below the median TIC were removed.'), ('MS_COMMENTS', 'MS acquisition: The LC/MS platform consisted of a 1290 Infinity II UHPLC coupled to a 6545 QTOF mass spectrometer via Dual AJS ESI source (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) and was controlled using MassHunter data acquisition software (v.10.1).
