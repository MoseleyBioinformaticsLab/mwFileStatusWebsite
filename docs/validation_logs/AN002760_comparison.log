Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'Blood from human subjects at high risk for T1D (and healthy controls; n=4 each) were subjected to parallel unlabeled proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and transcriptomics. The integrated dataset was analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software for disturbances in the at-risk subjects compared to the controls. The final quadra-omics dataset contained 2292 proteins, 328 miRNAs, 75 metabolites, and 41 lipids that were detected in all samples. Disease/function enrichment analyses consistently indicated increased activation, proliferation, and migration of immune cells, particularly, CD4 T-lymphocytes and macrophages. Integrated molecular network predictions highlighted central involvement and activation of NF-κB, TGF-β, VEGF, arachidonic acid, and arginase, and inhibition of miRNA Let-7a-5p. Parallel multi-omics provided a comprehensive picture of disturbances in high-risk T1D subjects and helped identify an associated integrated biomarker signature, which could ultimately facilitate the classification of T1D progressors from non-progressors.'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', '"Blood from human subjects at high risk for T1D (and healthy controls; n=4 each) were subjected to parallel unlabeled proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and transcriptomics.

Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', 'Subjects in the TN-01 study are tested semi-annually for the appearance of new or additional autoantibodies and are evaluated metabolically by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to assess their progression toward clinical diagnosis of T1D. Samples from healthy subjects (n=4) were collected as part of another study approved by the IRB of the University of Miami (study number 11995-115). These trials are conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and consistent with the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization. The protocol for the ancillary study, under which the current multi-omics analyses were performed, was approved by TrialNet (study ID number 195) and its IRB. The four high-risk subjects in the present report were staged for their risk level according to the TrialNet staging/scoring system, which considers family history, genetic susceptibility according to haplotype (e.g., HLA-DQ/DR), the number of autoantibodies, and OGTT results as follows: low-risk (1 autoantibody and normal OGTT); moderate-risk (2–3 autoantibodies and normal OGTT); high-risk (4–5 autoantibodies and normal OGTT); and very high-risk (4–5 autoantibodies and abnormal OGTT).'), ('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', '"Subjects in the TN-01 study are tested semi-annually for the appearance of new or additional autoantibodies and are evaluated metabolically by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to assess their progression toward clinical diagnosis of T1D.
