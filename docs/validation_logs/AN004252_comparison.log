Sections "PROJECT" contain missmatched items: {('EMAIL', 'motrpac-data-deposition@lists.stanford.edu'), ('PROJECT_SUMMARY', 'MoTrPAC is a national research consortium designed to discover and perform preliminary characterization of the range of molecular transducers (the "molecular map") that underlie the effects of physical activity in humans. The program\'s goal is to study the molecular changes that occur during and after exercise and ultimately to advance the understanding of how physical activity improves and preserves health. Preclinical and clinical studies will examine the systemic effects of endurance and resistance exercise across a range of ages and fitness levels by molecular probing of multiple tissues before and after acute and chronic exercise. This program is the largest targeted NIH investment of funds into the mechanisms of how physical activity improves health and prevents disease. The MoTrPAC program is supported by the NIH Common Fund and is managed by a trans-agency working group representing multiple NIH institutes and centers, led by the NIH Office of Strategic Coordination, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institute on Aging, and National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering. MoTrPAC Steering Committee: Wendy Kohrt, Chair, Russ Tracy, Co-Chair; NIH Program Manager, Concepcion Nierras. Euan Ashley and Matthew Wheeler are the PIs for the Motrpac Bioinformatics / Data Coordination Center.'), ('PROJECT_SUMMARY', 'The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) aims to elucidate how exercise improves health and ameliorates diseases by buildinga map of the molecular responses to acute and chronic exercise. MoTrPAC is a multi-site collaboration across the US encompassing various scientific disciplines: preclinical animal study sites and human clinical exercise sites, which perform the exercise testing and biospecimen collection; a consortium coordinating center and biorepository, which manages sample collection, distribution of samples, and consortium logistics; chemical analysis sites, which are responsible for omics analysis from the samples collected; and a bioinformatics center to collaboratively analyze and map the data generated by the other sites along with data dissemination to make the data and other resources available to the public. The animal studies enable analysis of the effects of exercise on many different tissues that are not readily obtainable inhumans, whereas the collection of accessible human tissues (muscle, blood, and adipose) will permit the analysis of the direct effect of exercise in humans.
