Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'The PCC 11802 was grown under ambient and 1% CO2 conditions in triplicates in shake flasks at 200 uE light intensity, 38 degrees C temperature, 120 rpm. The samples were collected in exponential phase (OD730 = 0.6).The metabolites were extracted using methanol-chloroform-water method as described in Metabolite Extraction Protocol file. The samples were stored in a -80 degrees C deep freezer until analyzed using LCMS.'), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'The PCC 11802 was grown under ambient and 1% CO2 conditions in triplicates in shake flasks at 200 uE light intensity, 38 degrees C temperature, 120 rpm.
