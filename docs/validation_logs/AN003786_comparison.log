Sections "PROJECT" contain missmatched items: {('PROJECT_SUMMARY', 'HER2-enriched breast cancer with high levels of hormone receptor expression, known as "triple positive" breast cancer, may represent a new entity with a relatively favourable prognosis against which the combination of chemotherapy, HER-2 inhibition, and endocrine treatment may be considered overtreatment. We explored the effect of the anticancer drugs tamoxifen and trastuzumab, both separately and in combination, on the integrated proteomic and metabolic profile of "triple positive" breast cancer cells (BT-474). Method We employed ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry using a Bruker timsTOF to investigate changes in BT-474 cell line treated with either tamoxifen, trastuzumab or a combination. Differentially abundant metabolites were identified using the Bruker Human Metabolome Database metabolite library and proteins using the Uniprot proteome for Homo sapiens using MetaboScape and MaxQuant, respectively, for identification and quantitation. Results A total of 77 proteins and 85 metabolites were found to significantly differ in abundance in BT-474 treated cells with tamoxifen 5 μM/and or trastuzumab 2.5 μM. Findings suggest that by targeting important cellular signalling pathways which regulate cell growth, apoptosis, proliferation, and chemoresistance, these medicines have a considerable anti-growth effect in BT-474 cells. Pathways enriched for dysregulation include RNA splicing, neutrophil degranulation and activation, cellular redox homeostasis, mitochondrial transmembrane transport, ferroptosis and necroptosis, ABC transporters and central carbon metabolism. Conclusion Our findings in protein and metabolite level research revealed that anti-cancer drug therapy had a significant impact on the key signalling pathways and molecular processes in triple positive BT-474 cell lines.'), ('PROJECT_SUMMARY', 'HER2-enriched breast cancer with high levels of hormone receptor expression, known as triple positive breast cancer, may represent a new entity with a relatively favourable prognosis against which the combination of chemotherapy, HER-2 inhibition, and endocrine treatment may be considered overtreatment.
