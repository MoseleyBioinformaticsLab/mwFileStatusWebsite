Sections "MS" contain missmatched items: {('MS_COMMENTS', "The Agilent 6550 Q-TOF-MS system was calibrated and tuned following the manufacturer's recommended protocols. High-purity nitrogen (&gt;99.999%) was used as both the sheath gas and drying gas, with flow rates of 8 L/min and 15 L/min, respectively. The drying and sheath gas temperatures were set at 250\u202f°C, and the nebulizer pressure was maintained at 35 psig. Positive ionization mode was employed with a voltage of +3000 V. The fragmentor voltage was set to 180 V. Data acquisition covered a mass range of 40–1200 m/z in the positive all ion fragmentation mode, including 3 sequential experiments at alternating collision energies: one full scan at 0 eV, followed by one MS/MS scan at 10 eV, and then one MS/MS scan at 30 eV. Mzmine was used for feature assignments."), ('MS_COMMENTS', "The Agilent 6550 Q-TOF-MS system was calibrated and tuned following the manufacturer''s recommended protocols.
