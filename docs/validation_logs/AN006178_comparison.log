Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', "Gemcitabine (GEMC) resistant (GEMR) cells were produced by serial treatment with escalating doses of GEMC for approximately 12 weeks. The final concentration of GEMC for Panc1 cells was 150 nM, resulting in a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 720.5 nM (approximately 2.5 times increase over control (CON) cells, 273.3 nM). The final concentration of GEMC for MiaPaCa2 cells was 64 nM, resulting in a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 92.2 nM (approximately 3x increase over control (CON) cells, 30.6 nM). Knockdown experiments were performed in adherent cells grown in 6 well plates for 72 h. Cells were seeded at 1-3105 cells/well and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were transfected with Silencer Select siRNA targeting ACACA (s883), FASN (s5030), SCD (s12505,s12504) FADS2 (s18025,s18023) or negative control (Silencer Select Negative Control No. 1) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent as per the manufacturer''s instructions (ThermoFisher Scientific). Sample groups include source - blank, fatty acid methyl ester (FAMEs) reference standard, pooled internal quality controls (iQC), MiaPaCa2 & Panc1 cells group1 - siRNA knockdown groups, negative control (siNEG), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (siSCD) and fatty acid desaturase 2 (siFADS2). group2 - control (CON) or gemcitabine-resistant (GEMR) cells batch - two different batches were process to ensure a minimum n&gt;2"), ('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', "Gemcitabine (GEMC) resistant (GEMR) cells were produced by serial treatment with escalating doses of GEMC for approximately 12 weeks.
