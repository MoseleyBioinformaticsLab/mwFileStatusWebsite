Sections "PROJECT" contain missmatched items: {('PROJECT_SUMMARY', "Pathological changes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) begin decades before cognitive symptoms appear. Chronic exposure to environmental neurotoxins like manganese (Mn) from sources such as air pollution and water can impact disease development across decades. Mn toxicity can lead to motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms resembling Parkinson''s disease, attributed to its accumulation in globus pallidus. In contrast, the impact of chronic lower-level exposures on normal and neuropathological brain function is unknown. We tested whether 10 months of a high Mn diet (2400 ppm) could alter aspects of glutamate signaling in APP/PSEN1 mice to further exacerbate cognitive impairments compared to control fed animals (70 ppm). This study supports the potential role for chronic environmental exposures in the development of Alzheimer’s disease associated neuropathology."), ('PROJECT_SUMMARY', "Pathological changes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) begin decades before cognitive symptoms appear.
