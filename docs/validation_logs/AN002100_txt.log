MS-DIAL parameters were set to 10 for minimum peak width, 10000 for minimum peak height, MS/MS fragmentation match to library of at least 80%, MS1 tolerance of 0.005 Da, MS2 tolerance of 0.01 Da, smoothing level of 3, and retention time window of 0.15 minutes for retention time matching to an in-house m/z-RT library developed from authentic standards. Tandem MS spectra were matched to library spectra from the Mass Bank of North America (MoNA), NIST17, and LipidBlast.[20] Features that appeared in method blanks were removed from further investigation. Duplicate peaks, isotopes, and adducts were investigated and removed using Mass Spectral Feature List Optimizer.[21] Manual inspection of each annotated compound was conducted to confirm m/z-RT library match, and/or MS/MS library match. Peak height was used as mass spectral intensity at a specific retention time for each annotated lipid. After data processing, each sample was normalized to the total summed intensity of all known features (excluding internal standards).'), ('ACQUISITION_DATE', '02_15_2018'), ('COLLISION_ENERGY', 'NCE 20.30.40'), ('IONIZATION', 'Positive'), ('SCAN_RANGE_MOVERZ', '120-1200'), ('SCANNING_CYCLE', 'Top 4 ions selected for MS/MS'), ('MS_RESULTS_FILE', 'ST001264_AN002100_Results.txt UNITS:Peak Height (Normalized Intensity) Has m/z:Yes Has RT:Yes RT units:Minutes')])
