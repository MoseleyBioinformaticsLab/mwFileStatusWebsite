SCHEMA: Section "CHROMATOGRAPHY" does not match the allowed schema. Wrong key 'SOLVENT_C' in OrderedDict([('CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY', 'The C18 column is operated parallel to the HILIC column for simultaneous analytical separation and column flushing through the use of a dual head HPLC pump equipped with 10-port and 6- port switching valves. During operation of the C18 method, the MS is operated in negative ion mode and 10 ÃŽÂ¼L of sample is injected onto the C18 column while the HILIC column is flushing with wash solution. Flow rate is maintained at 0.4 mL/min until 1.5 min, increased to 0.5mL/min at 2 min and held for 3 min.
