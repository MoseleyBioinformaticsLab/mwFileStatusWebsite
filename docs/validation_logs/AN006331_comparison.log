Arterial stiffness is recognized as a pivotal predictor and an independent risk element for CVDs. This study explores the metabolomic profiling of blood samples obtained from individuals afflicted with early arterial stiffness along with Vit D deficiency and obesity, compared with a healthy control group with normal Vit D and non-obese individuals. The study comprised nine participants with Vit D deficiency (Vit D level of 20 ng/ml or lower), and obese participants (BMI ≥ 30), along with eleven control participants (with Vit D levels above 20 ng/ml and normal BMI). Eleven metabolites exhibited statistically significant differences in patients with Vit D deficiency and obesity. Of these, eight metabolites demonstrated increased levels (FC &gt; 2, p &lt; 0.05), including Nutriacholic acid, N-Acetylputrescine, Succinylacetone, Adenosine monophosphate, Elaidic acid, Niacinamide, DUMP, and 2-Pyrrolidinone, while three metabolites exhibited decreased expression: PC (18:1(9Z)/18:1(9Z)), Trimethylamine, and Imidazole. The enrichment analysis revealed that top metabolic pathways predicted to be altered in the context of dysfunctional enzymes, encompassing processes such as nicotinamide acid uptake, fatty-acyl-CoA synthase (n-C18:0CoA), and extracellular NADP nucleosidase, among others. The ROC analysis showed that the blood metabolite concentrations can reliably differentiate with acceptable accuracy (AUC &gt;0.8, p&lt;0.05) between individuals at risk of arterial stiffness with Vit D deficiency and obesity from healthy controls showing the highest discriminator effect for DUMP and Niacinamide with AUC &gt; 0.9 and p&lt;0.00005. A combination metabolites model calculated with the linear SVM model achieved the highest performance of AUC=0.996 (95% CI: 0.97-1) and a predictive accuracy of 94.5% with the combination of seven metabolites. Integration of metabolomics and previous transcriptomics data identifies among the Vit D deficient and obese group disturbances in metabolic and regulatory pathways potentially related to vascular health such as inositol phosphate metabolism. The average PWV value relative to the participant''s age as previously reported was 19.4 ± 4.7 m/s in the group with both Vit D deficiency and obesity, compared to 14.7 ± 2.1 m/s in the healthy control group (p &lt; 0.05), indicating increased arterial stiffness."), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) continue to pose a significant global health challenge, with vitamin D (Vit D) deficiency and obesity emerging as prominent risk factors.
