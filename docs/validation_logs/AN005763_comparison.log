Cell culture was performed at 37°C in a carbon dioxide thermostat with 5% CO2. The medium was renewed every day. For treatment, sodium (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB, Sigma-Aldrich, China) was added to the medium to assess its effects on the cell proliferation process. For the metabolomic analysis of CT26 cells, this study was divided into a control group (n = 10) and a 5 mM-3HB group (n = 10). The control group was CT26 cells cultured without any intervention and the 5 mM-3HB group was CT26 cells treated with the addition of 5 mM 3-HB for 24 hours. The tumor-bearing mice were randomly assigned to two groups and subjected to the corresponding interventions. One group of tumor-bearing mice received a daily intraperitoneal injection of ethyl 3-hydroxybutyrate at a dose of 2 mM/kg per day (CACK, n = 8), and correspondingly, the other group of tumor-bearing mice (CAC, n = 8), as well as the control group (NOR, n = 8), was injected daily with an equal volume of PBS. all mice were subjected to a total of 21 days of the intervention.
