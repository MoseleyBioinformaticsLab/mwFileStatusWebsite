Sections "SAMPLEPREP" contain missmatched items: {('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', '"NEFA of mouse spinal cord Lipids will be quantified in myelin isolated in high yield and purity by subcellular fractionation from the lumbosacral spinal cord. While there are no absolutely ‘myelin-specific’ lipids, galactocerebroside is the most typical of myelin in the adult nervous system being directly proportional to the amount of myelin. Sulfatide is another galactolipid enriched in myelin. Together with cholesterol, these form 78% of the total amount of lipid in the myelin membrane and each will be quantified using LC/MS/MS. A highly sensitive assay for galactocerebroside was recently established by the Mayo Metabolomics Core and can be implemented immediately. The LC/MS/MS panel for free fatty acids, including the very long chain fatty acids found in myelin is also routinely performed by the Core. Cholesterol will be quantified using an NMR-based approach by the Mayo Dept. of Laboratory Medicine Clinical Core. Additionally, we have a plan in place with the Metabolomics Core to develop LC/MS/MS assays for sulfatide and sphingomyelin during the Pilot proposal. Having quantitative assays for each of these key myelin lipids will facilitate our goal to comprehensively profile myelin lipid metabolism and will form foundational assays for a future NIH grant focused on myelin metabolism."'), ('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', 'NEFA of mouse spinal cord Lipids will be quantified in myelin isolated in high yield and purity by subcellular fractionation from the lumbosacral spinal cord.
