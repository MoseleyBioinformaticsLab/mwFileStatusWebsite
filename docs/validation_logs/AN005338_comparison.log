Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'Human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 wildtype (WT) cells and the stably transduced MDA-MB-231 shZeb1 (stable Zeb1 knockdown) and shCtrl cell lines (control cell line for the stable Zeb1 knockdown) (Spaderna et al. 2008, DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5682) were treated with DMSO or RSL3 (1 or 10 µM) for 2 h, 4 h, 6 h or 24 h. The cell pellets were collected and analyzed for their oxidized phospholipid profile by UPLC-MS/MS. Please note that one sample set was measured three times with the same sample-ID, but with different methods (Ox-PE, Ox-PC, Ox-PI), therefore each sub-class has their own raw-data file marked by their corresponding abbreviation (Ox-PE, Ox-PC, Ox-PI; e.g. 210514_MDA_ZEB1_oxPE_dil_UD_std_1ul_JZ_oxPE_MRM_003.wiff, 210514_MDA_ZEB1_oxPC_dil_UD_std_1ul_JZ_oxPC_MRM_002.wiff or 210514_MDA_ZEB1_oxPI_dil_UD_std_1ul_JZ_oxPI_MRM_001.wiff).'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'Human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 wildtype (WT) cells and the stably transduced MDA-MB-231 shZeb1 (stable Zeb1 knockdown) and shCtrl cell lines (control cell line for the stable Zeb1 knockdown) (Spaderna et al. 2008, DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5682) were treated with DMSO or RSL3 (1 or 10 µM) for 2 h, 4 h, 6 h or 24 h.
