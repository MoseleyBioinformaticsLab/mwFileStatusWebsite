Sections "SAMPLEPREP" contain missmatched items: {('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', '1. Switch on bath to pre-cool at –20°C (±2°C validity temperature range) 2. Gently rotate or aspirate the blood samples for about 10s to obtain a homogenised sample. 3. Aliquot 30μl of plasma sample to a 1.0 mL extraction solution. The extraction solution has to be prechilled using the ThermoElectron Neslab RTE 740 cooling bath set to -20°C. 4. Vortex the sample for about 10s and shake for 5 min at 4°C using the Orbital Mixing Chilling/Heating Plate. If you are using more than one sample, keep the rest of the sample on ice (chilled at <0°C with sodium chloride). 5. Centrifuge samples for 2min at 14000 rcf using the centrifuge Eppendorf 5415 D. 6. Aliquot two 450μL portions of the supernatant. One for analysis and one for a backup sample. Store the backup aliquot in -20°C freezer. 7. Evaporate one 450μL aliquots of the sample in the Labconco Centrivap cold trap concentrator to complete dryness. 8. The dried aliquot is then re-suspended with 450 μL 50% acetonitrile (degassed as given above). 9. Centrifuged for 2 min at 14000 rcf using the centrifuge Eppendorf 5415. 10. Remove supernatant to a new Eppendorf tube. 11. Evaporate the supernatant to dryness in the Labconco Centrivap cold trap concentrator. 12. Submit to derivatization.'), ('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', '"1.
