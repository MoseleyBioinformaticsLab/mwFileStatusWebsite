Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', 'Two barley genotypes (Hordeum vulgare L.), the Austrian landrace HOR 2110 (termed “B1”) and the breeding line HOR 4710 (termed “B2”) were used. For each genotype, seedlings were grown in a greenhouse in pots (30 x 30 x 15 cm, 4 plants per pot) at a 23/15 °C day/night cycle until anthesis. After half of the spikes had flowered, plants were kept for another seven days under the same conditions, and then randomly selected and subjected either to "control" conditions (C, 22/18 °C and regular watering) or "elevated temperature" (ET, 28/25 °C and regular watering,) or "drought" (D, 22/18 °C and 15 % field capacity). After harvest, seeds were cleaned, dried at 20 °C and 20 % relative humidity (RH) for eight weeks (for after-ripening), and then stored at 18 °C.'), ('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', 'Two barley genotypes (Hordeum vulgare L.), the Austrian landrace HOR 2110 (termed “B1”) and the breeding line HOR 4710 (termed “B2”) were used.
