SCHEMA: Section "STUDY" does not match the allowed schema. Wrong key 'DISEASE_ASSOCIATION' in OrderedDict([('STUDY_TITLE', 'Loss of vitamin C biosynthesis protects from the pathology of a Schistosome infection and egg production.'), ('STUDY_TYPE', 'Treatment experiment'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'The processes influenced by ascorbate treatment in schistosome reproduction were investigated by metabolomics analysis of Ascorbate-treated and -untreated worm samples in the culture media. The top metabolite enriched in ascorbate-treated schistosomes was L-DOPA, a product of tyrosinase activity, which crosslinks vitellocyte proteins to form the schistosome eggshell, consistent with a role for ascorbate in vitellocyte development.'), ('INSTITUTE', 'University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas'), ('DEPARTMENT', 'Children’s Medical Center Research Institute'), ('LABORATORY', 'Michalis Agathokleous'), ('LAST_NAME', 'Agathokleous'), ('FIRST_NAME', 'Michalis'), ('ADDRESS', '6000 Harry Hines Blvd, NL12.110N, Dallas, TX, 75235'), ('EMAIL', 'michail.agathokleous@utsouthwestern.edu'), ('PHONE', '2146486270'), ('DISEASE_ASSOCIATION', 'Schistosomiasis')])
