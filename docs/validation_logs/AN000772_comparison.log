mwTab files contain different blocks: "{'Data', 'NMR_BINNED_DATA'}"
Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'Blood samples for metabolome, transcriptome, and miRNome profiling were obtained from the jugular vein at rest (Basal, T0) and/or immediately after the end of the competition (T1). Pretreatment of the blood samples was carried out immediately after the collection because the access to refrigeration and electrical power supply was available under the field conditions. Briefly, whole blood samples from each horse were collected in sodium fluoride and oxalate tubes for metabolome profiling in order to inhibit further glycolysis that may increase the lactate levels after sampling. Whole blood draw for plasma generation was put at once at 4ºC to minimize the metabolic activity of cells and enzymes and kept the metabolite pattern almost stable. Clotting time at 4ºC was strictly controlled for all samples to avoid cell lyses and affect the components of the metabolome. After clotting at 4ºC, the plasma was separated from the blood cells, subsequently transported to the lab at 4ºC and frozen at -80\u2009°C (no more than 5 h later, in all cases).'), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', '"Blood samples for metabolome, transcriptome, and miRNome profiling were obtained from the jugular vein at rest (Basal, T0) and/or immediately after the end of the competition (T1).
