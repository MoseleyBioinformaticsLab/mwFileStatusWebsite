Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', '5×10^5 indicated cells were incubated with 100 µM stable [13C,15N] amino acids (MSK-A2-US-1.2, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) for indicated time and centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pelleted cells were extracted in 500 µl ice-cold Acetonitrile: Isopropyl Alcohol: water (3:3:2 v/v/v) and aliquoted as three technical replicates. The extracts were vortexed for 5 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 14,000 g for 2 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were dried by vacuum spin for subsequent derivatization and stored at -20 ℃.'), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'Sorted hematopoietic cells incubated with 100 µM stable [13C,15N] amino acids (MSK-A2-US-1.2, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) for 1 h or 24 h as indicated were collected into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube with 500 µl ice-cold Acetonitrile: Isopropyl Alcohol: water (3:3:2 v/v/v).
