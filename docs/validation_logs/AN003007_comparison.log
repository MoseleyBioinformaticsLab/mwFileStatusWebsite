Sections "CHROMATOGRAPHY" contain missmatched items: {('CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY', 'A 2 μL aliquot of the samples was injected into a Thermo Ultimate 3000 system equipped with an ACQUITY UPLC® HSS T3 column (150 × 2.1 mm, 1.8 μm, Waters, Milford, MA, USA) maintained at 40 °C. The mobile phase for positive mode analysis consists of 0.1% formic acid in water (phase C) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (phase D), while the mobile phase for negative mode analysis consists of 5 mM ammonium formate in water (phase A) and acetonitrile (phase B). Phase C and D, as well as phase A and B, were mixed and delivered at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min with a gradient program as follows: 0~1 min; 2% B.D  1~9 min, 2%~50% B.D  9~12 min, 50%~98% B.D  12~13.5 min, 98% B.D  13.5~14 min, 98%~2% B.D  14~20 min, 2% D-positive model (14~17 min, 2% B-negative model).'), ('CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY', 'A 2 μL aliquot of the samples was injected into a Thermo Ultimate 3000 system equipped with an ACQUITY UPLC® HSS T3 column (150 × 2.1 mm, 1.8 μm, Waters, Milford, MA, USA) maintained at 40 °C.
