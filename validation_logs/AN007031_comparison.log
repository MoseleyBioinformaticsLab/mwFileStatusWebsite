Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'Metabolism in the mature placenta is dynamic in response to a changing environment as well as evolving fetal needs. Beyond dictating the energetic state and furnishing molecular building blocks, cellular metabolism is linked to signal transduction and the stress response. A gestational "metabolic clock" has been proposed to provide insight into pregnancy outcomes, but only limited resolution of the changing placental metabolome has been available through studies of human and monkey tissues. Here we analyzed the placenta metabolome in wild-type mice every 24 hours during the final one-third of pregnancy. Among other changes, there was a notable decline in NAD+ precursors approaching the final day of gestation.'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'Metabolism in the mature placenta is dynamic in response to a changing environment as well as evolving fetal needs.

Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'All sample collection took place between 0900 and 1200 without prior fasting of the pregnant mice. Following timed matings in naively pregnant C57BL/6 mice between the ages of 6 and 21 weeks, at the indicated gestational age timepoint, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane prior to cardiac puncture and exsanguination. Placentas were quartered, then rinsed in sterile water and blotted dry prior to snap freezing in liquid nitrogen. One quarter each from the placentas of two male littermates were pooled to constitute each placenta sample. The combined weight was recorded prior to metabolite extraction.
