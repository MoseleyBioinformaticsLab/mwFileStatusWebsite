Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "HepG2 cells were procured from National Institute of Cell Science (Pune, India) and cells were cultures as per our previously standardized method (Rezgui et al., 2023). In brief, cells were cultured (37°C and 5% CO2) in low-glucose Dulbecco''s Modified Eagle Medium (HiMedia,India) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 UI/mL penicillin, 100 ug/mL streptomycin,and 25 ug/mL amphotericin B. An Olympus inverted microscope (model) was used to track cell development during sub-culturing, which was carried out at intervals of 45–50 h. A cell counting equipment (Far-scope B, Curiosis) was used to do the trypan blue cell count."), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "HepG2 cells were procured from National Institute of Cell Science (Pune, India) and cells were cultures as per our previously standardized method (Rezgui et al., 2023).
