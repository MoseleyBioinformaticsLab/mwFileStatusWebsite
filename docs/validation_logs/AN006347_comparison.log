Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', "We compared the effects of Indian Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative (IFFCO) nano urea formulation with equimolar conventional urea on the metabolome of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Seedlings were grown in hydroponics in 1/4th strength Hoagland''s solution for 12 days, then transferred to a nitrogen-free modified Hoagland''s solution and grown for 21 days. Thereafter whole seedlings were crushed in lquid nitrogen to a fine powder. To 500 mg of fine powder, 5 mL of HPLC-grade methanol was added, and the sample was shaken/vortexed for over 30 minutes to extract analytes. The sample was spun at 8,000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the liquid phase, which was then transferred to a fresh tube and stored at -20°C. Derivatization was not done, as it was not required for non-volatile compounds. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry was conducted using GC-MS model QP2010 (Shimadzu®) using a SH-I-5Sil MS Capillary (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 µm) column. 2 µL of samples were injected using a splitless injection mode. Helium (1 mL/min) was used as a carrier gas. Ionization of 70 eV and a running time of 9.10 min – 52.0 min was used. The oven Program included an initial temperature of 45°C for 2 min, ramped to 140°C at 5°C/min, and then increased to 280°C, held isothermally for 10 min. The NIST14.L library (2020) was used to identify compounds based on retention times and mass spectra."), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', "We compared the effects of Indian Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative (IFFCO) nano urea formulation with equimolar conventional urea on the metabolome of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings.
