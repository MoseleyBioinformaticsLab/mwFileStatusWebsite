This then leads to the activation, proliferation and further activation of other immune cell populations including NK cells or immunosuppressive populations such as Tregs and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). These studies were carried out utilizing murine brain tumor models treated with an RNA DC vaccine platform. We hypothesized that metabolomic analyses of urines would be sensitive to the action of this diverse set of immune cells. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using metabolomics to follow immune responses after immunotherapy. We chose NMR as our analytical technique of choice, as it has many favorable qualities that make it ideal for analyses of urine.'), ('INSTITUTE', 'University of Florida'), ('DEPARTMENT', 'Applied Physiology and Kinesiology'), ('LABORATORY', 'Rm 042'), ('LAST_NAME', 'Khattri'), ('FIRST_NAME', 'Ram'), ('ADDRESS', '1200 Newell Dr., ARB 240, Gainesville, FL, 32611, USA'), ('EMAIL', 'rbk11@ufl.edu'), ('NUM_GROUPS', '10'), ('TOTAL_SUBJECTS', '80'), ('NUM_MALES', 'NA'), ('NUM_FEMALES', 'NA'), ('STUDY_COMMENTS', 'Metabolomic profiling of urine samples'), ('PUBLICATIONS', 'Metabolomics journal (submitted)'), ('ANALYSIS_TYPE_DETAIL', 'Metabolomic profiling of urine samples via NMR'), ('STUDY_TYPE', 'Cancer surrogate biomarker discovery'), ('PHONE', '3307856045')])
