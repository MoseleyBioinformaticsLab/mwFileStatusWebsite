Sections "MS" contain missmatched items: {('MS_COMMENTS', 'MS experiments were preformed over a scan range of 150-2000 m/z, maximum ion injection time was set to 200 ms, and orbitrap resolution was 24000. Raw spectral data from LC-MS experiments were pre-processed using Compound Discoverer v3.0.0 software (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA) and the XCMS web-based application (xcmsonline.scripps.edu). Initial steps involved retention time alignment between samples, peak area integration, peak picking, and QC area normalization. Features eluting with the solvent front or having retention times below 0.75 min were removed to account for potential ion suppression effects in that retention time region. ChemSpider and in-house mzVault database searches were used to obtain a list of tentative IDs based on accurate mass, isotope pattern, and MS/MS data whenever possible. Each lipid feature was identified according to the following confidence levels: (1) compounds matched to existing in house database standards by accurate mass (&lt;2 ppm), isotopic abundance, fragmentation spectrum, and retention time; (2) compounds annotated according to accurate mass, isotopic abundance, and fragmentation consistent with Lipid Maps and Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) entries; (3) accurate mass match matched to Lipid Maps and HMDB entries and fragmentation showing a few matching characteristic fragment ions.'), ('MS_COMMENTS', 'MS experiments were preformed over a scan range of 150-2000 m/z, maximum ion injection time was set to 200 ms, and orbitrap resolution was 24000.
