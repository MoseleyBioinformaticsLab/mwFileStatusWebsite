Both strains were grown under normal conditions at 27°C. The most significant metabolic changes between these strains were related to amino acid metabolism, purine metabolism, and carboxylic acid metabolism."), ('INSTITUTE', 'University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus'), ('LAST_NAME', 'Chorna'), ('FIRST_NAME', 'Nataliya'), ('ADDRESS', 'University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus, Department of Biochemistry, Main Building, 6th Floor, Room A-632, San Juan, PR 00935'), ('EMAIL', 'nataliya.chorna@upr.edu'), ('PHONE', '787-758-2525 ext 1640'), ('NUM_GROUPS', '2'), ('TOTAL_SUBJECTS', '26'), ('ANALYSIS_TYPE_DETAIL', 'GC-MS')])
