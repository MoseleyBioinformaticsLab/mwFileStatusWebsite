SCHEMA: Section "STUDY" does not match the allowed schema. Wrong key 'ANALYSIS_TYPE_DETAIL' in OrderedDict([('STUDY_TITLE', 'Systemic host inflammation induces stage-specific transcriptomic modification and slower maturation in malaria parasites'), ('STUDY_TYPE', 'Biomedical research'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'We found that host inflammation altered the plasma environment surrounding Plasmodium falciparum parasites in vivo, and that this altered plasma environment contained inhibitory factors that directly impaired maturation of early trophozoite stages. We demonstrated with LPS-conditioning that systemic host inflammation alone, in the absence of confounding factors such as ongoing infection, slowed the rate at which parasites transited from one generation of RBC to the next. While this is consistent with the idea that host inflammatory responses can impair parasite maturation, other TLR agonists, CpG and Poly I:C, did not elicit such a response. Metabolomics also identified 1-methylhypoxanthine as elevated in both LPS conditioned and acutely-infected plasma. Plasmodium survival depends on host hypoxanthine, inosine and xanthine for purine synthesis. 1-Methylhypoxanthine can bind effectively to and possibly limit the action of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRTase)25, an enzyme critical for purine synthesis. Interestingly, hypoxanthine, inosine and xanthine were also all reduced in the plasma of LPS-conditioned and acutely infected mice supporting the possibility that inhibition of purine synthesis by 1-methylhypoxanthine might have been partly aided by the lack of substrates for this pathway.'), ('INSTITUTE', 'Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity'), ('DEPARTMENT', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology'), ('LABORATORY', 'Ashraful Haque lab'), ('LAST_NAME', 'Skinner'), ('FIRST_NAME', 'Oliver'), ('ADDRESS', '792 Elizabeth Street, The University of Melbourne, Victoria 3000 Australia'), ('EMAIL', 'ollie.skinner@unimelb.edu.au'), ('PHONE', '+61 424088268'), ('NUM_GROUPS', '5'), ('TOTAL_SUBJECTS', '25'), ('NUM_MALES', 'NA'), ('NUM_FEMALES', 'NA'), ('STUDY_COMMENTS', 'Malaria parasite cultures treatments: CpG, LPS, PbA, PIC, Saline'), ('PUBLICATIONS', 'Systemic host inflammation induces stage-specific transcriptomic modification and slower maturation in malaria parasites'), ('ANALYSIS_TYPE_DETAIL', 'untargeted metabolomics')])
