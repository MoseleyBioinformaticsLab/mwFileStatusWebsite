Sections "SAMPLEPREP" contain missmatched items: {('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', 'Aliquots of each de-identified sample were shipped to the NIH ERCMRC on dry ice and immediately stored at -80 °C after being logged in for metabolomics analysis. A total of 298 study urine samples were thawed at 4°C overnight. Aliquots of 400 µL of study samples were transferred to 2.0mL pre-labeled LoBind Eppendorf tubes. Aliquots of 400 µL of analytical quality control (QC) external pooled urine samples were also transferred to 2.0mL pre-labeled LoBind Eppendorf tubes. All samples were mixed with 300uL of NMR Master Mix solution containing Chenomx ISTD: DSS-d6 and Phosphate Buffer at 7.4 pH in D2O. The tubes were vortexed for 5 min on a multi-tube vortexer and centrifuged at 16,000 rcf for 10 min. A 600uL aliquot of supernatants were transferred into a pre-labeled 5mm 4" NMR tubes for data acquisition on a 700 MHz spectrometer.'), ('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', 'Aliquots of each de-identified sample were shipped to the NIH ERCMRC on dry ice and immediately stored at -80 °C after being logged in for metabolomics analysis.
