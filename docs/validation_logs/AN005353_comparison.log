Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('SUBMIT_DATE', '2023-10-16'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'Recent studies report molecular mechanisms underlying iron-sulfur cluster (Fe-S) biosynthesis and suggest its importance in health and disease. However, a role for Fe-S biosynthesis in cancer contexts remains unclear. Here we report that FDX2, an Fe-S assembly factor, is indispensable for maintenance of cellular Fe-S-containing proteins (Fe-S protein(s)) and proliferation of ovarian cancer (OVC) cells. CRISPR-screening of all metabolism-related genes in OVC cells identified several Fe-S assembly genes as essential for OVC growth. Using an inducible FDX2-KO OVC line, we found that FDX2 loss promotes either senescence-like growth arrest or cell death, depending on TP53 status. Mechanistically, FDX2-loss caused global but differential post transcriptional down-regulation of Fe-S proteins, in turn perturbing respiration, iron-regulation and redox homeostasis, all associated with DNA damage. These results demonstrate significant roles for Fe-S biosynthesis in OVC proliferation and survival and provide information about how the cellular Fe-S-protein network responds to disruptions in Fe-S assembly.'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'Recent studies report molecular mechanisms underlying iron-sulfur cluster (Fe-S) biosynthesis and suggest its importance in health and disease.
