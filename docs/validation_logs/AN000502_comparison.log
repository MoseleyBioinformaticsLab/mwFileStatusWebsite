Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', 'Seven-week-old C57BL6J male mice were purchased from Daehan bio-link (Chungbuk, Republic of Korea). All mice were acclimated for 1 week under controlled conditions (temperature: 25 ± 2°C, relative humidity: 50 ± 5%, and 12 h light/dark cycle). The animals had free access to a normal diet (AIN-76A, Research Diets, Inc., NJ, USA) and water. After 1 week, the mice were randomly distributed into 5 groups: (1) group normal-diet (ND) (n = 11) was fed a normal diet for 6 weeks, (2) group HFD (named HD; n = 10) was fed 60 kcal% fat (D1242, Research Diets, Inc., NJ, USA) for 6 weeks, (3) group HFD with xenical administration (HX, 50 mg?kg?1?day?1) n = 10, 6 weeks, (4) group HFD with CLM administration (HCLM, 2 g?kg?1?day?1) n = 10, 6 weeks; and (5) group HFD with FCLM (CLM fermented for 60 h) administration (HFCLM, 2 g?kg?1?day?1) n = 8, 6 weeks. In this study, we used xenical as a positive control for antiobesity effects. Xenical, CLM, and FCLM dissolved with saline were orally administered everyday into the stomach with an oral zonde needle. And, the equal volume of saline were applied for ND and HD groups. During the experimental periods, the feed intake and the body weight of the mice were measured daily.'), ('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', 'Seven-week-old C57BL6J male mice were purchased from Daehan bio-link (Chungbuk, Republic of Korea).
