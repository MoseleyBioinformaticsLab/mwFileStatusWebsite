Hypotheses 1.Increasing SHS exposure will be associated with increases in asthma morbidity, systemic inflammation and oxidative stress.

SHS exposure will be associated with a worsened asthma and increases in systemic inflammation and oxidative stress among overweight/obese children compared to normal weight children.

Secondhand smoke (SHS) is a common exposure in homes of children in Baltimore City and approximately 50-80% of households have a smoker. Secondhand smoke has been associated with worse asthma outcomes.
