Sections "SAMPLEPREP" contain missmatched items: {('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', "The harvested leaf material was quenched with liquid nitrogen before being crushed into powder with a mortar and pestle. The samples were weighed (1 g) suspended in 80% cold (4 °C) aqueous analytical grade methanol (Romil''s Chemistry, Cambridge, UK).at a 1:10 m/v ratio. The mixture was then homogenised with a probe sonicator (Bandelin Sonopuls, Berlin, Germany) at 55% power for 10 seconds per sample. To avoid cross-contamination, equipment was cleansed between each sample. The homogenates were centrifuged at 5100 x g for 20 min at 4 °C in a benchtop centrifuge after which the supernatants were kept and concentrated by evaporating the methanol under vacuum to approximately 1 mL using a rotary evaporator set to 55 °C. The concentrated samples were transferred to 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes and dried in a centrifugal evaporator under vacuum. The dried extracts were then reconstituted by dissolving in 500 μL of 50% aqueous methanol (MilliQ deionised water and LC-grade methanol (Romil, Cambridge, UK). The samples were subsequently filtered through nylon syringe filters (0.22 μm) into chromatography vials fitted with 500 μL inserts, capped, and kept at 4 °C until analysis."), ('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', "The harvested leaf material was quenched with liquid nitrogen before being crushed into powder with a mortar and pestle.
