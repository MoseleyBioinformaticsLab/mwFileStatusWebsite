Sections "SAMPLEPREP" contain missmatched items: {('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', "1. Thawing the Samples Take the frozen fecal samples stored at - 80°C out of the freezer. Place them on ice in a cold room or a cold - box to thaw slowly. Avoid rapid thawing at room temperature, as this may cause chemical changes in the metabolites due to temperature shock. Ensure that the samples are completely thawed but still kept cold throughout the process. 2. Homogenization Weighing: Transfer the thawed fecal sample into a pre - weighed sterile tube. Weigh the tube with the sample to determine the weight of the fecal material. Record this value accurately. Addition of extraction solvent: Add an appropriate amount of extraction solvent. For example, a common choice is a mixture of methanol and water (e.g., 80:20 v/v ratio). The volume of the solvent added should be proportional to the weight of the fecal sample, typically 3 - 5 times the weight of the feces (in mL per mg). Homogenization process: Use a homogenizer (such as a bead - beating homogenizer or a sonicator) to break down the fecal matrix and release the metabolites into the solvent. If using a bead - beating homogenizer, add sterile beads (e.g., zirconia beads) to the tube, and set the homogenizer to an appropriate speed and time (e.g., 3000 - 6000 rpm for 2 - 5 minutes). If using a sonicator, place the tube in the sonic bath and apply ultrasonic waves for a suitable duration (e.g., 10 - 20 minutes with intermittent cycles). 3. Centrifugation After homogenization, transfer the homogenized sample to a centrifuge tube. Centrifuge the sample at a high speed (e.g., 10,000 - 15,000 g) for 10 - 15 minutes at 4°C. This step will separate the insoluble fecal particles from the supernatant containing the extracted metabolites. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a new sterile tube using a pipette, avoiding disturbing the pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge tube. 4. Sample Clean - up (Optional) Solid - phase extraction (SPE): If necessary, perform SPE to further purify the metabolite extract. Select an appropriate SPE cartridge based on the properties of the metabolites to be analyzed. Condition the cartridge according to the manufacturer's instructions, then load the supernatant onto the cartridge. Wash the cartridge with appropriate solvents to remove impurities, and finally, elute the metabolites with a suitable elution solvent. Filtering: Pass the supernatant or the eluted sample through a 0.22 - μm or 0.45 - μm filter to remove any remaining particulate matter. This step helps to prevent clogging of the analytical instruments during metabolite sequencing. 5. Concentration and Drying (Optional) If the concentration of metabolites in the sample is too low for the subsequent sequencing analysis, the sample can be concentrated. This can be achieved using methods such as rotary evaporation or nitrogen - blowdown. For rotary evaporation, transfer the sample to a round - bottom flask and place it in a rotary evaporator. Evaporate the solvent under reduced pressure at a suitable temperature (e.g., 30 - 40°C). For nitrogen - blowdown, place the sample in a glass vial and gently blow a stream of nitrogen gas over the surface of the sample until the solvent is evaporated. After concentration, the sample may be dried completely. If the sample is to be stored for a long time, it is advisable to dry it under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas or in a vacuum desiccator. 6. Re - dissolution and Storage Re - dissolve the dried or concentrated sample in an appropriate solvent, such as a mixture of water and organic solvent (e.g., methanol or acetonitrile) suitable for the metabolite sequencing instrument. The volume of the re - dissolution solvent should be adjusted according to the required concentration for analysis. Transfer the re - dissolved sample to a clean, labeled vial for storage. Store the sample at - 80°C until it is ready for metabolite sequencing. Avoid repeated freeze - thaw cycles to maintain the stability of the metabolites."), ('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', "1.

Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', "In this study, we constructed a mouse model of osteoporosis by performing ovariectomies and administering irisin injections. The impact of ovariectomy was assessed based on changes in body and uterine weights. Bone microstructure analysis, HE staining, MASSON staining, and Goldner staining were employed to observe alterations in bone structure. Post-irisin injection, mice showed recovery in weight and restoration of bone structure, including the formation of new bone. The presence of bone-forming factors (ALP, BGP), bone resorption factors (CTX-1, TRACP-5b), and a bone protective protein (OPG) indicated that irisin could promote bone cell growth in bone tissue. Additionally, HE staining and immunohistochemical analysis on intestinal sections revealed that irisin restored the mucosal barrier of the intestinal wall and alleviated enlargement of intestinal epidermal cells. Analysis of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels demonstrated irisin''s role in reducing inflammation. Furthermore, sequencing and analysis of intestinal flora 16S microbial sequencing and blood metabolome in mice revealed that irisin mitigated the dysbiosis caused by osteoporosis and promoted flora growth, while enrichment analysis showed that irisin induced changes in basal metabolic levels. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of irisin in treating osteoporosis and its beneficial effects on the intestinal barrier and flora, suggesting that irisin enhances intestinal protection to foster bone tissue repair."), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', "In this study, we constructed a mouse model of osteoporosis by performing ovariectomies and administering irisin injections.
