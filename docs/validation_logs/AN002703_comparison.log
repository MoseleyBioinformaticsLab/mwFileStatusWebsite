Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'A prospective clinical and observational study of patients with anaphylactic reactions was performed. Patients of all ages and both sexes were recruited at outpatient clinics and the departments of Emergency, and other services at Hospital La Fe. All fulfilled clinical criteria of anaphylaxis and severity was graded following the classification by Brown, et al3. Patients were classified as food, drug or idiopathic origin, as well as in mild, moderate or severe according to the number of organs affected and clinical symptoms. The allergy evaluation was conducted by the Allergology Service of Hospital La Fe. The ethical committee approved the study protocol and all subjects were informed and provided written consent. Serum samples were taken during the acute moment of the reaction at the first moment of medical attention ( less than 2h, hereafter referred as ‘T1’), and after clinical recovery (approximately 2-4h later, referred to as ‘T2’). Patients were treated according to the Galaxy 2016 practical guide, using all necessary drugs to rescue them. Samples were collected, following specific standard operating procedures (SOPs)31-33. Briefly, these were collected in a vacutainer tube (Ref. 368965) and processed within the first 30 to 60 min after blood extraction. Sample aliquots were stored at -80ºC until further analyses. Subsequently, between 2-3 months after the anaphylaxis, a serum sample was taken when the allergy evaluation was performed (basal state, called ‘T0’).'), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'A prospective clinical and observational study of patients with anaphylactic reactions was performed.
