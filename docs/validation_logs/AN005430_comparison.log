Sections "PROJECT" contain missmatched items: {('PROJECT_SUMMARY', "Lipid droplet-associated hydrolase (LDAH) has a lipase structure and high affinity for lipid droplets of macrophages/foam cells. However, LDAH''s functions and lipid substrates remain poorly understood. In this project we treated mouse peritoneal macrophages isolated from LDAH-transgenic, LDAH-deficient mice, and their respective wild-type littermate controls with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and analyzed the effects of LDAH overexpression and LDAH deficiency on their lipidome."), ('PROJECT_SUMMARY', "Lipid droplet-associated hydrolase (LDAH) has a lipase structure and high affinity for lipid droplets of macrophages/foam cells.
