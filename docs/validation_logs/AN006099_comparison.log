Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', '5 µL of TIF or plasma sample was mixed with 45 µL of ice-cold acetonitrile containing stable isotope labeled amino acid mix from Cambridge Isotope Labs(MSK-A1-1.2) as internal standards. Only 3 uL were analyzed for sample TIF_07 due to low sample volume from TIF extraction. Samples were vortexed, incubated on ice for 20 minutes, centrifuged at 20,000g for 20mins at 4°C and the supernatant was transferred to an autosampler vial for LC-MS analysis. Arginine calibration curves was prepared from 0.1µ-500 µM levels.'), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', '5 µL of TIF or plasma sample was mixed with 45 µL of ice-cold acetonitrile containing stable isotope labeled amino acid mix from Cambridge Isotope Labs(MSK-A1-1.2) as internal standards.
