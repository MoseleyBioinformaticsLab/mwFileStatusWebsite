Sections "SAMPLEPREP" contain missmatched items: {('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', 'Before starting, calculate the volume of 1:1:1 choloroform:methanol:isopropanol resuspension buffer needed for each sample. Volume of 1:1:1 is dependent on normalize cell count from experiment. Use 200uL of 1:1:1 for every 2E5 cells. When ready to start resuspension, remove dried lipids from -80C storage and resuspend in volume of 1:1:1 solution calculated for each sample. No cell conditions use 200uL. Use gentle vortex to allow for dried lipids from vial wall to get into solution. Prepare "blank" vials of 1:1:1 for buffer background analysis. Store lipids in autosampler between 4-7C.'), ('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', 'Before starting, calculate the volume of 1:1:1 choloroform:methanol:isopropanol resuspension buffer needed for each sample.
