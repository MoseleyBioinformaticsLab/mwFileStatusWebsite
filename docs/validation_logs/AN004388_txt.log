SCHEMA: Section "CHROMATOGRAPHY" does not match the allowed schema. Wrong key 'SOLVENT_C' in OrderedDict([('CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY', 'Global metabolomics profiling was performed on a Thermo Q-Exactive Oribtrap mass spectrometer with Dionex UHPLC and autosampler. Each extract was spiked with 1 ul of standard mixture consisting of deuterium labeled carnitine, acetylcarnitine, propionylcarnitine, butyrylcarnitine, isovalerylcarnitine, octanoylcarnitine, myristoylcarnitine and palmitoylcarnitine to targeted identification of carnitines in the sample. All samples were analyzed in positive and negative heated electrospray ionization with a mass resolution of 35,000 at m/z 200 as separate injections. Separation was achieved on an ACE 2 Excel-C18 pfp, 100x2.1mm, 2um column with mobile phase A as 0.1% formic acid in water and mobile phase B as acetonitrile. This is a polar embedded stationary phase that provides comprehensive coverage, but does have some limitation is the coverage of very polar species. The flow rate was 350 µL/min with a column temperature of 25°C. 4 µL was injected for negative ions and 2 µL for positive ions.'), ('CHROMATOGRAPHY_TYPE', 'Reversed phase'), ('INSTRUMENT_NAME', 'Thermo Dionex'), ('COLUMN_NAME', 'ACE 5 C18-300 (100 x 2.1mm)'), ('SOLVENT_A', '100% water; 0.1% formic acid'), ('SOLVENT_B', '100% acetonitrile'), ('SOLVENT_C', '-'), ('FLOW_GRADIENT', '-'), ('FLOW_RATE', '350 µL/min'), ('COLUMN_TEMPERATURE', '25°C')])
