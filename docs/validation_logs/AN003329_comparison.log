Sections "PROJECT" contain missmatched items: {('PROJECT_SUMMARY', 'The attached MSI datasets of GBM and prostate cancer tissues were analyzed in the manuscript by Abdelmoula et al. (bioRxiv 2021.05.06.442938). The below is taken from the abstract: Motivation: Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) provides rich biochemical information in a label-free manner and therefore holds promise to substantially impact current practice in disease diagnosis. However, the complex nature of MSI data poses computational challenges in its analysis. The complexity of the data arises from its large size, high dimensionality, and spectral non-linearity. Preprocessing, including peak picking, has been used to reduce raw data complexity, however peak picking is sensitive to parameter selection that, perhaps prematurely, shapes the downstream analysis for tissue classification and ensuing biological interpretation. Results: We propose a deep learning model, massNet, that provides the desired qualities of scalability, nonlinearity, and speed in MSI data analysis. This deep learning model was used, without prior preprocessing and peak picking, to classify MSI data from a mouse brain harboring a patient-derived tumor. The massNet architecture established automatically learning of predictive features, and automated methods were incorporated to identify peaks with potential for tumor delineation. The model’s performance was assessed using cross-validation, and the results demonstrate higher accuracy and a 174-fold gain in speed compared to the established classical machine learning method, support vector machine.'), ('PROJECT_SUMMARY', 'The attached MSI datasets of GBM and prostate cancer tissues were analyzed in the manuscript by Abdelmoula et al.
