Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', "Metabolomics analysis is a powerful tool in biomedical research that allows to analyze in detail the small molecules metabolites present in biological systems. These metabolites provide crucial information about the metabolic pathways and processes found inside tissues, cells, and living things. In the context of nanoparticle studies, when zinc oxide nanoparticles with peptide (ZnOPs) were used, metabolicomics caused the changes in metabolism caused by nanoparticles. When zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO) were used to treat breast cancer, metabolomics studies revealed a distinct metabolic pattern when compared to untreated samples. These alterations might be due to abnormalities in signaling pathways, stress responses, and cellular metabolism brought on by exposure to nanoparticles. The potential of the metabolomics data to distinguish between several groups suggests that ZnO nanoparticles significantly affect the metabolomics of treated cells. L-norleucine is a prospective candidate for cancer therapy because of its ability to disrupt cancer cell metabolism, growth signaling pathways, and angiogenesis . Continued research into L-norleucine's anticancer characteristics could lead to the development of new therapeutic options for various cancers.6-Diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine is a glutamine antagonist with anticancer activity proven in numerous preclinical trials. L-norleucine metabolite is present abundantly when treated with ZnOPs. Higher level of L-phenyl alanine was found when treated with ZnOPs compared to control. Previous research has demonstrated that l-phenylalanine acts as a transporter for anticancer medicines, delivering medication molecules straight into the tumor site . This can not only prevent cancer cell multiplication, but also lessen drug side effects. Oxaloacetic acid (OAA) is an important step in the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle), a critical route in cellular metabolism. While OAA has not been thoroughly explored in the context of cancer, changes in the citric acid cycle and other metabolic pathways have been linked to cancer biology.Oxaloacetate has the potential to directly affect the Warburg effect in cancer cells. Oxaloacetate (OAA) competitively inhibits human lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), preventing it from working in cancer cells. OAA promotes a favorable (alkaline) cellular environment that enables the success of other treatments. Quinaldic acid is thought to be a byproduct of kynurenic acid, a tryptophan metabolite that has antiproliferative capabilities against cancer. Quinaldic acid altered the phosphorylation levels of ERK 1/2, p38, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and Akt (protein kinase B) kinases .Quinaldic acid was shown abundantly when treated with ZNOPs."), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', "Metabolomics analysis is a powerful tool in biomedical research that allows to analyze in detail the small molecules metabolites present in biological systems.
