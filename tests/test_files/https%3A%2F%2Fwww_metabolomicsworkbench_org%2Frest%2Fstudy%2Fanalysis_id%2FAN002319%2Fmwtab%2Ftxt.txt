#STUDY
ST:STUDY_TITLE                   	Natural history of the systemic responses to a renal inoculation of
ST:STUDY_TITLE                   	uropathogenic E. coli in swine
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	Background: The pathogenesis of systemic infection and its progression to sepsis
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	remains poorly understood. Progress in the field has been stifled by the
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	shortcomings of experimental models which include poor replication of the human
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	condition. To address these challenges, we developed a novel large animal model
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	of systemic infection that is capable of generating high-dimensional clinically
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	relevant data. Methods: Male swine (n=5) were anesthetized, mechanically
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	ventilated, and surgically instrumented for continuous hemodynamic monitoring
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	and serial blood sampling. Animals were inoculated with uropathogenic E. coli by
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	direct injection into the renal parenchyma and were maintained under anesthesia
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	for up to 24 hours. The natural history of the infection was studied, animals
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	were not resuscitated. Multi-dimensional data were collected hourly to every 6
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	hours; all animals were euthanized when at predetermined physiologic endpoints.
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	Results: Core body temperature progressively increased from mean (SD) 37.9(0.8)
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	̊C at baseline to 43.0(1.2) ̊C at experiment termination (p=0.006). While mean
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	arterial pressure did not begin to decline until 6h post inoculation, dropping
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	from 86(9) mmHg at baseline to 28(5) mmHg (p=0.005) at termination. Blood
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	glucose progressively declined but lactate levels did not elevate until the last
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	hours of the experiment. There were also temporal changes in whole blood
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	concentrations of a number of metabolites including increases in the
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	catecholamine precursors, tyrosine (p=0.005) and phenylalanine (p=0.005). Lung,
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	liver, and kidney function parameters worsened as infection progressed and at
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	study termination there was histopathological evidence of injury in these
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	end-organs. Conclusion: We demonstrate a versatile, multi-dimensional,
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	longitudinal, swine model of systemic infection that could be used to further
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie infection-induced multi-organ
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	dysfunction and failure, optimize resuscitation protocols and test therapeutic
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	interventions. Such a model could improve translation of findings from the bench
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	to the bedside, circumventing a significant obstacle in sepsis research.

#COLLECTION
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	Whole blood (WB) samples were collected from the indwelling line in the internal
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	jugular vein. Blood was collected into 4ml Vacutainer tubes containing sodium
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	heparin. Following collection, tubes were inverted several times to ensure
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	adequate mixing and were immediately placed on ice. Each of two 600uL aliquots
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	were added to screw-top cryogenic storage tubes and flash frozen in liquid
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	nitrogen. Frozen samples were placed on dry ice until the completion of the
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	experiment at which time they were transferred to storage in liquid nitrogen and
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	stored until the time of assay. The remaining whole blood volume in the
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	collection tube was centrifuged (1300g for 10 min at 4C). Aliquots of
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	plasma(~600uL) were transferred into screw-top cryogenic storage tubes, flash
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	frozen in liquid nitrogen, placed on dry ice, and stored in liquid nitrogen for
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	future assays.

#TREATMENT
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	Male swine (n=5) were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, and surgically
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	instrumented for continuous hemodynamic monitoring and serial blood sampling.
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	Animals were inoculated with uropathogenic E. coli by direct injection into the
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	renal parenchyma and were maintained under anesthesia for up to 24 hours. The
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	natural history of the infection was studied, animals were not resuscitated.
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	Multi-dimensional data were collected hourly to every 6 hours; all animals were
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	euthanized when at predetermined physiologic endpoints.
#SAMPLEPREP
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	Whole blood samples were thawed on ice and subjected to a methanol-chloroform
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	precipitation. Briefly, samples were thawed in an ice-water bath after which 500
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	μL of blood was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and 1ml of a 1:1
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	methanol-chloroform solution was added. Samples were sonicated for 2 minutes at
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	4°C, then incubated at -20°C for 20 minutes, and then centrifuged (13,400g at
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	4°C for 30 minutes). The aqueous supernatant was transferred to a new
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	microcentrifuge tube and dried by lyophilization. Samples were then resuspended
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	in 600 μL of 50mM sodium phosphate buffer in D2O for NMR analysis.
