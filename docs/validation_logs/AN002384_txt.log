SCHEMA: Section "STUDY" does not match the allowed schema. Wrong key 'ANALYSIS_TYPE_DETAIL' in OrderedDict([('STUDY_TITLE', 'Dependence of the Staphylococcal Volatilome Composition on Microbial Nutrition'), ('STUDY_TYPE', 'Untargeted MS'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'Introduction: In vitro cultivation of staphylococci is fundamental to both clinical and research microbiology, and selection of growth medium will substantially influence staph growth rates, genetic integrity, pathogenicity, and metabolic capacity. Few studies, to-date, have investigated how the differences in rich media can influence the volatilome of cultivated bacteria. Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the influence of rich media composition on the chemical characteristics of the volatilomes of Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis. Methods: S. aureus (ATCC 12600) and S. epidermidis (ATCC 12228) were cultured in triplicate in four rich complex media (BHI, LB, MHB, and TSB), and the volatile metabolites produced by each culture were analyzed using headspace solid-phase microextraction combined with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography – time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC×GC-TOFMS). Results: When comparing the chemical compositions of the staph volatilomes produced in each medium, we observed few differences when the presence versus absence of volatiles were compared. However, when the relative abundances of volatiles were included in the analyses, we observed that culturing staph in media containing free glucose (BHI and TSB) resulted in volatilomes dominated by acids and esters (67%). The low-glucose media (LB and MHB) produced ketones in greatest relative abundances, but the volatilome compositions in these two media were highly dissimilar. Conclusion: The staphylococcal volatilome is strongly influenced by the nutritional composition of the growth medium, especially the availability of free glucose, which is much more evident when the relative abundances of the volatiles are analyzed, compared to the presence versus absence.'), ('INSTITUTE', 'Arizona State University'), ('DEPARTMENT', 'School of Life Sciences'), ('LABORATORY', 'Heather D.
