Sections "MS" contain missmatched items: {('MS_COMMENTS', "Fifteen cycles of matrix were sprayed onto indium tin oxide (ITO) slides with a flow rate of 125 µL/min. The gas pressure used for spraying and the temperature were individually set to 10 psi and 60 °C. The EPSON Scan software was employed to scan the slides and obtain the raw images, which were analyzed using timsTOF fleX (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) for MALDI-MSI analysis. The detection range of m/z was from 500 to 1250, and the spatial resolution of MALDI imaging was set to 10 μM. SCiLS Lab Version 2023b pro was applied to analyze the raw imaging data. The differential lipids between control and DOX treatment groups were screened based on the area under curve (AUC) value ≥ 0.75 and p value &lt; 0.05. The structure of differential lipids was further identified. Identification of lipid molecules was based on the database within Bruker's MetaboScape 2024b software."), ('MS_COMMENTS', "Fifteen cycles of matrix were sprayed onto indium tin oxide (ITO) slides with a flow rate of 125 µL/min.
