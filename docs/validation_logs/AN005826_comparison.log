Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', "With growing concerns about beef production''s impact on health and environment, there is increasing interest in practices that may improve the soil-plant-animal-human health continuum. We compared three Southern US grass-fed beef systems to grain-fed control, examining effects on soil health in terms of physicochemical properties whereas feed and beef samples were tested for metabolomic profile using orbitrap mass spectrometer. Pasturelands displayed healthier soils compared to paired feedcrop lands, showing 1.4-fold more organic matter and 1.7 to 3.0-fold higher potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and zinc levels (all, p&lt;0.05). Of 784 compounds analyzed, 165 differed between grass-fed and grain-fed beef (all, p&lt;0.05). Grass-fed beef had 3.1-fold higher phytochemical antioxidants, tied to 118.2-fold higher precursor levels in pasture samples compared to total mixed rations (p&lt;0.05). This resulted in reduced oxidative stress in grass-fed animals, with 0.35- and 0.37-fold lower levels of homocysteine and 4-hydroxynonenal glutathione, respectively (both, p&lt;0.05). Findings highlight potential linked benefits across the soil-plant-animal-human nutrition continuum in beef production."), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', "With growing concerns about beef production's impact on health and environment, there is increasing interest in practices that may improve the soil-plant-animal-human health continuum.
