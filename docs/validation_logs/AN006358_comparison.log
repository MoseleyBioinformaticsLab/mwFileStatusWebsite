Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'CELLS: IMR90-ER:RAS fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM medium (GIBCO), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO) and 1x penicillin/streptomycin (GIBCO). Cells were maintained at 37\u2009°C in the presence of 5% CO2. For the metabolic analysis, cells were transfected in 6- well plates in triplicates with siRNA control, siRNA against DLST or siRNA against sin-lncRNA using RNAiMax (Invitrogen). 24h later, they were treated with 500nM 4-OHT to induce senescence for 6 days. After that cells were washed and sent on dry ice for analysis. INCUBATIONS: The samples indicated with the "Precursor" parameter 13C5-Glutamine were incubated with 4mM uniformly 13C-labelled glutamine and the ones indicated with Glutamine were incubated with 4mM non-labelled glutamine. CURVE: Curve samples as defined in the study design were serial dilutions of the pooled analytes (alpha ketoglutarate, Citrate, Glutamate, Glutamine, Isocitrate, Malate) in water/MeOH (75/25 %v/v). The following concentrations in µM were used: 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, 2.5, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1, 0.05, 0.025 and 0 (blank). Curve_12 has the highest concentration and Curve_00 is the blank.'), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'CELLS: IMR90-ER:RAS fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM medium (GIBCO), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO) and 1x penicillin/streptomycin (GIBCO).
