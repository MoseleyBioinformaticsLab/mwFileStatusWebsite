Sections "MS" contain missmatched items: {('MS_COMMENTS', "The mass spectrometer was set to full scan (70-1000 m/z), with the spray voltage set to 4.0 kV, heated capillary to 350°C, and the HESI probe at 30 °C. The sheath gas flow was set at 10 units, auxiliary gas at 1 units, and sweep gas flow at 1 unit. The resolution of scan was set to 70,000, AGC target to 1x106, and maximum injection time at 20 msec. An additional scan between 220-700 m/z was used to enhance nucleotide detection in the negative mode as well with the maximum injection time set to 80 msec. Data acquired by Thermo Fisher's Xcalibur software and analyzed by their Tracefinder software. The raw files provided contain data from both positive and negative ion mode."), ('MS_COMMENTS', "The mass spectrometer was set to full scan (70-1000 m/z), with the spray voltage set to 4.0 kV, heated capillary to 350°C, and the HESI probe at 30 °C.
