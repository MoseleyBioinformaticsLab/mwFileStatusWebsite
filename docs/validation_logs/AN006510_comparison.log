Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "HEK293T. HeLa, eHAP, MCF7 and 143B cells were cultured in either Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Thermo Fisher Scientific) or IMDM media, supplemented with 10 % (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS, CellSera), 50 µg/mL uridine (Sigma), and a mixture of 100 µg/mL streptomycin and 100 units/mL penicillin (Thermo Scientific). For stable isotopologue tracing of 13C5-glutamine (Merck), media was replaced with glutamine-free DMEM (Thermo fisher Scientific) or IMDM supplemented with 2 mM of 13C5-glutamine, 1 mM pyruvate (Thermo Scientific), 10% FBS, 50 µg/mL uridine, and a mixture of 100 µg/mL streptomycin and 100 units/mL penicillin."), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "HEK293T.
