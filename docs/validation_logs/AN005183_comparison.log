Sections "PROJECT" contain missmatched items: {('FUNDING_SOURCE', 'Human Health Exposure Analysis Untargeted Resource Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai: M.

Plasma and adipose tissue samples were collected before and after bariatric surgery. Both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue were collected. Lipophilic pollutants, particularly persistent organic pollutants (POPs), bioaccumulate in adipose tissue. Therefore, we performed untargeted analysis with LC and GC-HRMS to measure chemicals and metabolites in the samples. These pollutant measures can then be linked to clinical and vascular parameters of cardiometabolic risk and to study the impact of weight loss on chemical levels following marked (20-30%) weight loss.'), ('PROJECT_TITLE', 'Untargeted analysis of plasma'), ('DOI', 'http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M80Q6D'), ('PROJECT_SUMMARY', 'Untargeted analysis of plasma from lean individuals and obese subjects at the time of bariatric surgery, with some repeat measures.')}

We hypothesize that pollutants that accumulate in fat depots promote adipose tissue dysfunction, in part, by activating inflammatory and pro-atherogenic signaling pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.
