Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "The study conforms to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki, and approval of the human clinical protocol and informed consent were obtained from the Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Ethics Committee (CER: 10059). All patients previously diagnosed with proliferative diabetic retinopathy or epiretinal membrane were followed clinically, and surgery was performed by a single vitreoretinal surgeon when indicated by 'standard-of-care' guidelines. Informed consent was obtained. Undiluted vitreous samples were aspirated in the region adjacent to neovascular tufts or epiretinal membrane (control) and were frozen on dry ice immediately after biopsy and stored at –80°C. All patients received their first anti-VEGF injection after vitreous sampling; they did not have prior anti-VEGF or photocoagulation treatment. Medication details are provided in the metadata table, except for four deceased diabetic patients whose records were no longer available (NA). Sex and gender factors were not analyzed due to insufficient statistical power when disaggregated."), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "The study conforms to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki, and approval of the human clinical protocol and informed consent were obtained from the Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Ethics Committee (CER: 10059).
