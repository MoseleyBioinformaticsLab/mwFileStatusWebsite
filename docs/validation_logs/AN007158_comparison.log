Sections "PROJECT" contain missmatched items: {('PROJECT_SUMMARY', "Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) are a type of multipotent stem cell found in the bone marrow stroma that can differentiate into various cell types, support the bone marrow''s microenvironment, and regulate other stem cells. Their key functions include providing physical support to hematopoietic stem cells, secreting factors that control their homeostasis, and undergoing differentiation into bone, cartilage, and fat cells. BMSCs are also being explored for various cell therapies due to their ability to be expanded in vitro. To determine the role of taurine in regulating metabolism of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), we carried out untargeted metabolomic analysis of murine taurine transporter (TauT) wild-type and knockout MSCs. Briefly, 16 week old TauT+/+ and TauT-/- mice were sacrificed, stromal populations were isolated and magnetically enriched or flow sorted for MSCs. Next, untargeted metabolomic analysis was carried out to identify metabolic changes induced by inhibiting taurine uptake in MSCs. This analysis identified inositol metabolism as a downstream effector of taurine in MSCs."), ('PROJECT_SUMMARY', "Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) are a type of multipotent stem cell found in the bone marrow stroma that can differentiate into various cell types, support the bone marrow's microenvironment, and regulate other stem cells.
