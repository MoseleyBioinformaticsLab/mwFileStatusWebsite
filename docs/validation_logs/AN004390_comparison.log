Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'This study employs targeted LC-MS analysis of choroid plexus (ChP) tissue to assess relative changes in the levels of intermediates from the central carbon metabolism, with additional attention to mitochondrial energy precursors (ATP/ADP, NAD(P) and NAD(P)H) at two time points in the diurnal cycle. For this purpose, mice were kept in a circadian cabinet housing with 12-hour light cycle (7 a.m. on/ 7 p.m. off) and tissues were collected consistently at an a.m and a p.m time point (9 a.m. and 9 p.m). Two different ChP tissues were collected for analysis (LV - left ventricle and 4V - 4th ventricle). Also two separate extractions were performed: 80% MetOH based (MetOH study factor) and FB (MetOH with Na-ascorbate and Na-acetate additives, FB study factor). The two extractions are optimal for central carbon metabolites or NAD(P)/H respectively.'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'This study employs targeted LC-MS analysis of choroid plexus (ChP) tissue to assess relative changes in the levels of intermediates from the central carbon metabolism, with additional attention to mitochondrial energy precursors (ATP/ADP, NAD(P) and NAD(P)H) at two time points in the diurnal cycle.
