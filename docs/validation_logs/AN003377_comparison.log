Sections "SAMPLEPREP" contain missmatched items: {('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', 'As stated in the paper: 4.4 mg/mL of 1,5-diaminonapthalene hydrochloride (CAS: 2243-62-41, Sigma-Aldrich, Darnstadt, Germany) was dissolved in 4/4.5/0.5 HPLC grade water/ethanol/1 M HCl (v/v/v). 28 The 10 µm thick tissue sections were sprayed using a TM-sprayer (HTX Technologies, Chapel Hill, NC) in a four-pass method. The parameters of the matrix application set in the TM-sprayer were as follows: spray nozzle velocity (1200 mm/min), track spacing (2 mm), flow rate (0.09 mL/min), spray nozzle temperature (75 °C), and nitrogen gas pressure (10 psi)'), ('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', 'As stated in the paper: "4.4 mg/mL of 1,5-diaminonapthalene hydrochloride (CAS: 2243-62-41, Sigma-Aldrich, Darnstadt, Germany) was dissolved in 4/4.5/0.5 HPLC grade water/ethanol/1 M HCl (v/v/v). 28 The 10 µm thick tissue sections were sprayed using a TM-sprayer (HTX Technologies, Chapel Hill, NC) in a four-pass method.

Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'As stated in the paper: "Colorectal tissue was stored at -80 °C until processing. Cryosections of the colorectal tissue, containing the adenoma, were taken at 10 µm thickness and were mounted on indium tin oxide (ITO) slides for MALDI MSI analysis. Serial sections were obtained for MALDI MSI and immunofluorescence microscopy using a pPDH antibody and DAPI staining. The cryosections used for immunofluorescence were 5 µm in thickness. Fluorescent microscopy images were acquired using a 40x objective (Zeiss Observer Z.1, Oberkochen, Germany), a DAPI filter (Filter Set 49, Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Oberkochen, Germany), and an FITC filter (31001, Chroma Technology Corporation, Bellows Falls, VT)."'), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'As stated in the paper: Colorectal tissue was stored at -80 °C until processing.
