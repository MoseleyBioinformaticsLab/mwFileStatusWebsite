SCHEMA: Section "CHROMATOGRAPHY" does not match the allowed schema. Wrong key 'SOLVENT_C' in OrderedDict([('CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY', 'All GC-MS analysis was performed with an Agilent 5977b GC-MS MSD-HES and an Agilent 7693A automatic liquid sampler. Dried samples were suspended in 40 µL of a 40 mg/mL O-methoxylamine hydrochloride (MOX) (MP Bio #155405) in dry pyridine (EMD Millipore #PX2012-7) and incubated for one hour at 37 °C in a sand bath. 25 µL of this solution was added to auto sampler vials. 60 µL of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoracetamide (MSTFA with 1%TMCS, Thermo #TS48913) was added automatically via the auto sampler and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C. After incubation, samples were vortexed and 1 µL of the prepared sample was injected into the gas chromatograph inlet in the split mode with the inlet temperature held at 250°C. A 50:1 split ratio was used for analysis for the majority of metabolites. Any metabolites that saturated the instrument at the 50:1 split were analyzed at a 150:1 split ratio. The gas chromatograph had an initial temperature of 60°C for one minute followed by a 10°C/min ramp to 325°C and a hold time of 10 minutes. A 30-meter Agilent Zorbax DB-5MS with 10 m Duraguard capillary column was employed for chromatographic separation. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a rate of 1 mL/min.'), ('CHROMATOGRAPHY_TYPE', 'GC'), ('INSTRUMENT_NAME', 'Agilent 5977b GC-MS'), ('COLUMN_NAME', 'Agilent DB5-MS (30m x 0.25mm, 0.25um)'), ('SOLVENT_A', 'NA'), ('SOLVENT_B', 'NA'), ('SOLVENT_C', 'NA'), ('FLOW_GRADIENT', 'NA'), ('FLOW_RATE', 'NA'), ('COLUMN_TEMPERATURE', '60°C for one minute followed by a 10°C/min ramp to 325°C and a hold time of 10 minutes')])
