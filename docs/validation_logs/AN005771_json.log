Wrong key 'SOLVENT_C' in OrderedDict([('CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY', 'Solvent A: Water; Solvent B: Acetonitrile; Solvent C: 10 mM ammonium acetate in water'), ('INSTRUMENT_NAME', 'Thermo Dionex Ultimate 3000'), ('COLUMN_NAME', 'Higgins Analytical C18 (50 x 2.1mm,2.6um)'), ('COLUMN_TEMPERATURE', '60'), ('FLOW_GRADIENT', 'Mobile phase conditions for the C18 column were 60% A, 35% B, 5% C for 0.5 min, with a linear gradient to 0% A, 95% B, 5% C starting at 1.5 min, and held for 3.5 min, resulting in a 5 min run.
