Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'To compare flavonoid metabolism in three tea cultivars, namely Camellia sinensis cv. Jinfenghuang (JFH), Fuyun 6 (FY6) and Bantianyao (BTY), fresh tea leaves were plucked, rapidly ground to fine powders in liquid nitrogen and subjected to extraction by 70% methanol. The extracts were analyzed by UPLC-Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-QTOFMS) using an ACQUITY UPLC system in tandem to a SYNAPT G2-Si QTOF mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA, USA), following the previously described method. Raw data were processed in Progenesis QI (v2.4, Nonlinear Dynamics) with default settings for peak picking and alignment. Metabolites were annotated by searching against our in-house MS/MS spectral library and public databases.'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'To compare flavonoid metabolism in three tea cultivars, namely Camellia sinensis cv.
