Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', "Pacific salmonid populations have been declining predominantly due to anthropogenic factors such as climate change, habitat loss, and water contaminants derived from urban storm water runoff. Growing urbanism has resulted in areas of impervious surfaces leading to increased storm water runoff entering urban rivers and streams. Storm water runoff has been correlated to escalating rates of pre-spawn mortality (PSM) events in coho salmon in Pacific Northwest streams. PSM events in salmonids are characterized by rapid onset symptoms including surface swimming, loss of equilibrium, and fin splaying that precede mass adult population mortality prior to egg fertilization. In 2020, a chemical derived from tires, N-(1,3-Dimethylbutyl)-N''-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine-quinone (6Q), was isolated from storm water runoff and subsequent toxicity tests resulted in acute coho salmon mortality exhibiting a 24-hour dose at fifty percent population mortality (LC50) of 95 ng/L. 6Q is an oxidation product derived from N-(1,3-Dimethylbutyl)-N''-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD), which is used by tire manufacturers as an antioxidant and antiozonant. The toxic mechanism of 6Q is not yet known, but it is suspected to induce an inhibitory effect on cytochrome P450 (CYP450) genes encoding for CYP450 enzymes, which are responsible for xenobiotic metabolism. We hypothesize 6Q exposure affects salmonids’ ability to synthesize essential structural and cell signaling molecules and inhibits their ability to metabolize other water contaminants such as polycyclic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs are a chemical class of concern due to their potential carcinogenic, teratogenic, and mutagenic effects in aquatic organisms. Thus, this project will focus on the commonly detected water PAH contaminant anthraquinone and its impact on salmonids when co-exposed to 6Q. Further, climate change may be a contributing factor to salmonid susceptibility to water contaminants. Increasing global carbon dioxide emissions have affected aquatic species significantly due to the ability of rivers and streams to transport or store atmospheric carbon dioxide, resulting in rapidly rising water temperatures having potential to exacerbate salmonid sensitivity to water contaminant"), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', "Pacific salmonid populations have been declining predominantly due to anthropogenic factors such as climate change, habitat loss, and water contaminants derived from urban storm water runoff.
