Wrong key 'ANALYSIS_TYPE_DETAIL' in OrderedDict([('STUDY_TITLE', 'Comparative metabolomics analysis of two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains: the wild type and mtl1Δ, which carries a deletion of the mechanosensor Mtl1p (part-II)'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', "To gather more in-depth knowledge of the Mtl1p mechanosensor's role in Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism, we conducted a comparative metabolomic analysis of two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains: the wild type and mtl1Δ, which carries a deletion of the mechanosensor Mtl1p. Both strains were grown under normal conditions at 27°C. The most significant metabolic changes between these strains were related to amino acid metabolism, purine metabolism, and carboxylic acid metabolism."), ('INSTITUTE', 'University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus'), ('DEPARTMENT', 'Biochemistry'), ('LAST_NAME', 'Chorna'), ('FIRST_NAME', 'Nataliya'), ('ADDRESS', 'University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus, Department of Biochemistry, Main Building, 6th Floor, Room A-632, San Juan, PR 00935'), ('EMAIL', 'nataliya.chorna@upr.edu'), ('PHONE', '7877582525 ext 1640'), ('NUM_GROUPS', '2'), ('TOTAL_SUBJECTS', '14'), ('ANALYSIS_TYPE_DETAIL', 'GC-MS')])
