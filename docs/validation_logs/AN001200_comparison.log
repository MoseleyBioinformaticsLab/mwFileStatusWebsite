Whole blood was drawn directly into stop soilution (1:1 ratio) at rest and again at peak exercise for each human subject. The samples were processed to plasma by MCRU and stored at -80 in the Biorepository.'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'This experiment was performed using the following cohorts: 1) healthy controls, 2) patients with scleroderma at low risk for pulmonary hypertension, 3) pateints with scleroderma at high risk for pulmonary hypertension (SSc Cath).
