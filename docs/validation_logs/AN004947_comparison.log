Sections "PROJECT" contain missmatched items: {('PROJECT_SUMMARY', "Metabolic changes precede malignant histology. However, it remains unclear whether detectable characteristic metabolome exists in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues and biofluids for early diagnosis. We conducted NMR- and MS-based metabolomics on 1,153 matched ESCC tissues, normal mucosae, pre- and one-week post-operative sera and urines from 560 participants across three hospitals, with machine learning, logistic regression and WGCNA. Aberrations in 'alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism' proved to be prevalent throughout the ESCC evolution, and were reflected in 16 serum and 10 urine metabolic signatures that were consistently identified by NMR and MS in both discovery and validation sets. NMR-based simplified panels of any five serum or urine metabolites outperformed clinical serological tumor markers (AUC = 0.984 and 0.930, respectively), and were effective in distinguishing early-stage ESCC in test set (serum accuracy = 0.994, urine accuracy = 0.879). Collectively, NMR-based biofluid screening can reveal characteristic metabolic events of ESCC and be feasible for early detection (ChiCTR2300073613)."), ('PROJECT_SUMMARY', "Metabolic changes precede malignant histology.
