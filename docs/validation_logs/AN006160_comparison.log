Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', 'PLASMA SAMPLES: Plasma samples underwent deproteinization and lipid extraction using an all-in-one single extraction method employing a solvent mixture composed of MeOH/MTBE/CHCl3 (4:3:3, v/v/v) for the isolation of non-polar lipids(1). The lipid extraction method started with thawing the samples on ice followed by a 2 min vortex homogenization. Subsequently, 40 µL of the plasma sample was mixed with 800 µL of the solvent mixture – also containing the internal standards (IS): 1 ppm C17-sphinganine and 2 ppm d31-palmitic acid –. The resulting mixture was vortex-mixed for 20 min followed by sample centrifugation at 16,100 x g for 10 min at 15 °C. Then, 300 µL of the supernatant were transferred to LC Chromacol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madrid, Sain) vials with insert and centrifuged at 16,100 x g for 10 min at 15 °C prior to the analysis. Blank solutions were prepared containing 40 µL of H2O and 800 µL of the solvent mixture and same procedure was followed. For quality control (QC) samples, three independent pools were prepared by pipetting 10 µL of each sample – for QCTOTAL –, 10 µL of Alport samples (cases 1 and 2) – for QCCASES –, and 10 µL of control samples (DM patients and healthy individuals) – for QCCONTROL–. Then 40 µL of each of the pools were transferred to Eppendorf™ tubes and 800 µL of the solvent mixture were added. The same procedure as in sample preparation was followed. Both blank and QC samples were processed in parallel with the rest of plasma samples. URINE SAMPLES: Urine samples were prepared at the Centro de Metabolómica y Bioanálisis, CEMBIO (Madrid, Spain), following a monophasic extraction method (MeOH:EtOH (1:1, v/v)), tested and developed in our laboratory to obtain the urine lipidomics fingerprint. Briefly, the samples were thawed on ice and then vortex-mixed for 2 min. On ice, 100 µL of urine sample was mixed with 300 µL of a cold (-20 °C) mixture of MeOH:EtOH (1:1, v/v), and a mixture of nonendogenous internal standards (C17-Sphinganine at 1 ppm and d31-palmitic acid at 2 ppm). Samples were vortex-mixed for 30 minutes. After centrifugation for 10 min at 16.1 rpm at 15 °C, 100 µL of the supernatant was collected and transferred into an HPLC-MS vial with a glass insert.
