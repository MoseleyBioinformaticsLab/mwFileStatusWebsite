Sections "SAMPLEPREP" contain missmatched items: {('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', '"Cortices from E11.5 to E13.5 were isolated in ice-cold DMEM and immediately collected into a safe-lock poly-propylene tube (2ml) with 750 µl of ice-cold quench mix and sonicated. 170 µl of H2O was mixed and stored at -80 ºC before lipid extraction. The single-phase sample (a mixture of 170 µl of an aqueous sample, 10 ng of internal standards [17:0/20:4 PI, 17:0/20:4 PI4P, and 17:0/20:4 PI(4,5)P2], and 750 µl of quench mix) were mixed with 725 µl of CHCl3 and 170 µl of 2 M HCl, followed by vortex-mixing and centrifugation (1,500 g, 5 min at room temperature). The lower organic phase was collected into a new 2 ml safe-lock poly-propylene tube and mixed with 708 µl of pre-derivatization wash solution, followed by vortex-mixing and centrifugation (1,500 g, 3 min at room temperature). The lower phase was collected into another fresh tube and subjected to derivatization. Fifty µl trimethylsilyl diazomethane in hexane (2 M solution) was added to the lipid extracts (~1 ml), and after leaving to stand 10 min at room temperature, the reaction was quenched with 6 µl of acetic acid. Next, 700 µl post-derivatization wash solution was added to the mixture, followed by centrifugation (1,500 g, 3 min). The resultant lower phase was collected and rewashed with a 700 µl post-derivatization wash solution. Samples were temporarily stored at -80 ºC. Ninety µl of methanol and 10 µl of H2O were added to the final collected lower phase. The samples were dried up with a centrifugal evaporator. Samples were dissolved in 80 µl methanol, sonicated for 1 min, and 20 µl H2O was added. After centrifugation at 15,000 g for 30 min at 4 ºC, the supernatants were collected. To avoid degradation, the samples were stored at -80 ºC until use.
