Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "Sample Collection and Metadata Fifty one (n=51) Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) were captured at various locations along the inflow of Loskop Dam, Mpumalanga, South Africa (25°28'22.8 S: 29°15'25.2 E) between May 2-6, 2016. On capture, blood was immediately drawn and collected in lithium heparin 3 mL vacutainers (BD vacutainer, Franklin Lakes, NJ). After the first blood draw, fish were kept in aerated tanks and transported back to the field station for necropsy. All fish work was conducted using the permit and animal handling protocol that was reviewed and approved by the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency (Project #ES 6/1 ). Upon arrival to the field station, blood was immediately centrifuged in collection tubes and 500 μL of plasma was aliquoted into cryogenic storage vials (Corning, Corning, NY) for lipidomic studies (n=51). Adipose tissue was removed during dissection and flash frozen and stored for lipidomics analysis. Juvenile fish with an ambiguous sex assignment were excluded. Pictures of the whole fish and individual biopsied tissues were taken under consistent lighting in a photo box for documentation. A subset of the sampled fish, representing individuals with varying degrees of disease severity with matched age, size, and weight, were selected for lipidomics of adipose tissue (n=31)."), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'Sample Collection and Metadata Fifty one (n=51) Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) were captured at various locations along the inflow of Loskop Dam, Mpumalanga, South Africa (25°28\'22.8" S: 29°15\'25.2" E) between May 2-6, 2016.
