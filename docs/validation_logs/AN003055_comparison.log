Sections "MS" contain missmatched items: {('MS_COMMENTS', 'LC-MS peak extraction, alignment, quantification and annotation was performed using LipidSearch software version 4.2 (Thermo Scientific). Only lipids present in  greater than 2/3 of the samples were kept for further analysis. Median normalization (excluding TAG and DAG) was applied to correct for differential starting material quantity. Missing values were imputed by drawing from a random distribution of low values in the corresponding sample. Lipids were identified by matching the precursor ion mass to a database and the experimental MS/MS spectra to a spectral library containing theoretical fragmentation spectra. The identity of cardiolipins, detected as [M-H]-, was manually validated by investigating individual MS/MS spectra. Lipid abundances were reported as spectral counts.'), ('MS_COMMENTS', 'LC-MS peak extraction, alignment, quantification and annotation was performed using LipidSearch software version 4.2 (Thermo Scientific).
