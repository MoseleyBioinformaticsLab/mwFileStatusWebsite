Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "In this study, a total of 91 participants were recruited, including 33 healthy controls (HC), 30 patients with ''Liver Depression and Qi Stagnation''( LQS) syndrome and gallstone disease, and 28 patients with ''Liver-Gallbladder Damp-Heat''(LGDH) syndrome. A dual-pronged strategy was employed to analyze the serum and urine samples. Firstly, a non-targeted platform based on UPLC-HRMS was used for global analysis, identifying [the number of non-targeted metabolic features in the serum] and [the number of non-targeted metabolic features in the urine] respectively."), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "In this study, a total of 91 participants were recruited, including 33 healthy controls (HC), 30 patients with 'Liver Depression and Qi Stagnation'( LQS) syndrome and gallstone disease, and 28 patients with 'Liver-Gallbladder Damp-Heat'(LGDH) syndrome.
