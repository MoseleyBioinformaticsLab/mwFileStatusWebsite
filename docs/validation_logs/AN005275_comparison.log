Sections "MS" contain missmatched items: {('MS_COMMENTS', "The mass spectrometer was operated in full scan, positive-ion mode, with the spray voltage set to 3.0 kV, the heated capillary at 275°C, and the HESI probe at 350°C. The sheath gas flow was 40 units, the auxiliary gas flow was 15 units, and the sweep gas flow was 1 unit. MS data was collected in a range of m/z = 200 –1000. The resolution set at 17,500, the AGC target at 3x106, and the maximum injection time at 250 msec. Data acquired by Thermo Fisher's Xcalibur software and analyzed by their Tracefinder software. The data reported includes the different adducts and reduced forms of the metabolites to show presence or lack thereof."), ('MS_COMMENTS', "The mass spectrometer was operated in full scan, positive-ion mode, with the spray voltage set to 3.0 kV, the heated capillary at 275°C, and the HESI probe at 350°C.

Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', "The 143B cell line were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (ThermoFisher) supplemented with 10% Heat Inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (ThermoFisher) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (ThermoFisher), and 100 µg/mL uridine (Sigma). Cells were kept in a 37°C incubator (Baker Ruskinn) held at 5% CO2 and 90% relative humidity. 25,000 – 50,000 cells were seeded in complete DMEM media. 24 hours later the media was changed with 1.25µL of 10mg/mL of doxycycline in 50mL of DMEM to induce RquA expression. The cells were incubated for 5-7 of days to proliferate and every 2 days the media was refreshed. For conditions done in hypoxia, cells were initially seeded in normoxia. 24 hours after seeding, the cells are transferred into the Invivo2 1000 workstation (Baker Ruskinn) with the oxygen tension set to 0.5% O2, the temperature to 37°C, the CO2 to 5%, and the relative humidity to 80%. Media would be changed in the Invivo2 1000 workstation the same as normoxia."), ('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', "The 143B cell line were cultured in Dulbecco''s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (ThermoFisher) supplemented with 10% Heat Inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (ThermoFisher) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (ThermoFisher), and 100 µg/mL uridine (Sigma).
