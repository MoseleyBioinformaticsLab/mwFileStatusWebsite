Sections "SAMPLEPREP" contain missmatched items: {('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', 'Exosomes were isolated from plasma by differential ultracentrifugation adapted from Refs. [47,48]. 0.7 mL cleared plasma (see above) were placed in 5 \x04 41 mm polyallomer ultraclear ultracentrifuge tubes on ice, and centrifuged for 1 h at 70,000 g at 4 \x14C in a SWTi55 swing out rotor (Beckman). The supernatant was recentrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4 \x14C, and the pellet was drained and resuspended in 0.7 mL cold PBS, and recentrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4 \x14 C. The washed exosomal pellets were resuspended in 100 mL nanopure water, vortexed for 30 s and transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube. The ultracentrifuge tube was washed with another 100 mL of nanopure water, vortexed for 30 s and the wash was transferred into same microcentrifuge tube, using the same pipet tip. The combined exosome suspensions were then lyophilized except for a small portion that was used for characterization by particle size distribution analysis (see below). These nanoparticles are operationally defined as exosomes. The lyophilized EXO preparations were extracted for lipidic metabolites using a solvent partitioning method with CH3CN:H2O:CHCl3 (2:1.5:1, v/v) as described previously [49]. The resulting lipid extracts were vacuum-dried in a vacuum centrifuge (Eppendorf), redissolved in 200 mL CHCl3:CH3OH (2:1) with 1 mM butylated hydroxytoluene, which was further diluted 1:20 in isopropanol/CH3OH/CHCl3 (4:2:1) with 20 mM ammonium formate for UHR-FTMS analysis.'), ('SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY', 'Exosomes were isolated from plasma by differential ultracentrifugation adapted from Refs.

Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'Ten mL samples of blood were drawn into a purple top vacutainer containing K2-EDTA (Becton-Dickson), inverted twice to ensure dissolution of the EDTA, and kept on ice immediately after blood draw. The whole blood was separated into packed red cells, buffy coat, and plasma within 30 min of collection by centrifuging at 3500 g for 15 min at 4 \x14C in a swing out rotor. All blood processing procedures were performed in a class II biosafety cabinet housed in a BSL category 2 laboratory. Plasma (0.7 mL) was aliquotted into 1.5 mL screw cap vials, flash frozen in liq. N2, and stored at\x03-80 \x14 C until exosomal isolation. These collection and processing procedures were designed to minimize variations in plasma and exosome quality.'), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'Ten mL samples of blood were drawn into a purple top vacutainer containing K2-EDTA (Becton-Dickson), inverted twice to ensure dissolution of the EDTA, and kept on ice immediately after blood draw.
