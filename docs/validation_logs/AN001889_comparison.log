Sections "CHROMATOGRAPHY" contain missmatched items: {('CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY', 'For GC-MS analysis, samples were dried under vacuum for at least 18 h prior to derivatization under dried nitrogen using bistrimethyl-silyltrifluoroacetamide. Derivatized samples were separated on a 5% diphenyl / 95% dimethyl polysiloxane fused silica column (20 m x 0.18 mm .D  0.18 um film thickness) with helium as carrier gas and a temperature ramp from 60° to 340°C over a 17.5 min period. Samples were analyzed on a Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ fast-scanning single-quadrupole mass spectrometer using electron impact ionization (EI) and operated at unit mass resolving power. The scan range was from 50–750 m/z.'), ('CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY', 'For GC-MS analysis, samples were dried under vacuum for at least 18 h prior to derivatization under dried nitrogen using bistrimethyl-silyltrifluoroacetamide.
