Sections "TREATMENT" contain missmatched items: {('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', "Plasmid/shRNA Construction and Virus Infection: Knockdown cell lines were generated by lentiviral infection. Briefly, 293T cells were co-transfected with these plasmids: psPAX2, pMD2.G and pLKO.1 (Hedgehog Bio Science and Technology Ltd. HH-shRNA-066) containing a shRNA sequence targeting PSAP mRNA. The following sequences were used: shPSAP 1: 5'- GAACTACGTGGACCAGTATTC-3'; shPSAP 2: 5'- GAATACTGGTCCACGTAGTTC-3'. The plasmids and shRNA were mixed in FBS-free DMEM with lipo 3000 kit (Invitrogen L3000015) to form a complex, and incubated with 293T cell line in FBS-free DMEM in 6-wells plates. The medium was changed with 10% FBS DMEM after 8h and co-infected in incubator for 48h. After co-infection, lentiviral supernatants were collected and mixed with virus concentration kit (Beyotime, C2901L). After 12000g centrifuging for 2min at 4℃, 4T1 cells were infected with shNC or shPSAP supernatants, as well as 10% FBS DMEM and 10μg/ml polybrene (Biosharp, BL628A) for 48 h. Stably PSAP knockdown 4T1 cells lines were selected with 2 μg/ml blasticidin."), ('TREATMENT_SUMMARY', "Plasmid/shRNA Construction and Virus Infection: Knockdown cell lines were generated by lentiviral infection.
