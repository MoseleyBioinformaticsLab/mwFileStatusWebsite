Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "The C57BL/6J mice were selected for the induction of CRC using azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS). Mice received an intraperitoneal injection of AOM (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 10 mg/kg body weight. One week later, they were given 2% (w/v) DSS (Meilunbio, Dalian, China) in drinking water for 5 days, followed by regular water for 14 days. This sequence, termed a DSS cycle, was repeated three times. Body weight and stool were continuously monitored until euthanasia at week 12. Since orthotopic colorectal tumors induced by AOM/DSS were not directly visible during the mice's lifetime, we determined the timing of sacrifice based on weight loss and behavioral observations. Mice were euthanized when they lost 20% of their pre-experiment body weight, showed signs of severe debilitation, or were on the verge of death, such as being unable to move, and/or body condition scoring (BCS) reached 2.0. Distal colon tissues were collected, and visible tumors on the colorectal mucosa were counted. The samples was saved at -80℃ condition."), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', "The C57BL/6J mice were selected for the induction of CRC using azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS).
