Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', "Haloxylon salicornicum is a xero-halophyte desert species that is a benchmark species for investigating the mechanisms of drought tolerance. Herein, we aimed to unravel the metabolic mechanisms involved in Haloxylon salicornicum''s natural adaptations to drought and soil chemical properties, as well as to identify key metabolites that are regulated in a rhythmic and seasonal manner in response to these conditions. To that end, two soil types (clay and sandy), two seasons (winter and summer), and two two-time points (dawn and midday) were selected. The plant’s hydric status was evaluated, along with primary metabolites, using untargeted metabolomic analysis. The soil variations had no significant effect on the plants’ physiological and metabolic behavior. However, across seasons, H. salicornicum showed high metabolic activities during dawn compared to midday, underscoring its metabolic plasticity to mitigate the effects of high temperatures and sunlight. During winter, the plant’s hydraulic status was relatively high (-1 MPa), facilitating the activation of anabolic pathways, such as carbon fixation and assimilation, as well as the biosynthesis of amino acids and carbohydrates to support growth and prepare carbon reserves. However, in response to the combined drought and heat stresses of summer, the plants exhibited low water potential values, reaching -5 MPa. This resulted in an arrest of anabolic processes and stimulation of catabolic pathways, particularly starch breakdown, to sustain carbon metabolism and maintain energy production. Additionally, efficient antioxidant molecules (e.g., ascorbic acid and caffeic acid) were synthesized to detoxify harmful radicals and protect cellular structures. These results provide valuable insights into the metabolic adaptations of H. salicornicum to its natural environment, offering a foundation for further studies of its genetic regulatory mechanisms."), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', "Haloxylon salicornicum is a xero-halophyte desert species that is a benchmark species for investigating the mechanisms of drought tolerance.

To this end, plants were studied across two soil types (clay and sandy), two seasons (winter and summer), and two time points (dawn and midday). Hydric status and primary metabolites were evaluated using untargeted metabolomics. Soil type had minimal impact on physiological and metabolic responses. However, H. salicornicum exhibited marked diel and seasonal variations in metabolism. During winter, higher water potential (–1 MPa) supported anabolic pathways such as carbon assimilation and the biosynthesis of amino acids and carbohydrates. In contrast, summer drought conditions (–5 MPa) led to the suppression of anabolic activities and the activation of catabolic pathways, including starch degradation, to sustain energy metabolism. The synthesis of antioxidants such as ascorbic and caffeic acids further contributed to cellular protection under stress. These results highlight the metabolic plasticity of H. salicornicum and offer valuable insights into its adaptive strategies, laying the groundwork for future studies on the genetic regulation of drought tolerance in desert ecosystems."), ('PROJECT_SUMMARY', "We attempted to elucidate the metabolic mechanisms involved in Haloxylon salicornicum's natural adaptations to drought and soil properties, as well as to identify key metabolites that are regulated in a rhythmic and seasonal manner in response to these environmental conditions.
