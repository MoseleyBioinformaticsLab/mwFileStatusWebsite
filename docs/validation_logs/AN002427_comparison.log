Procedure: 3.1 Pre-Run Procedures 3.1.1 Instrument tuning (Instrument in Tune mode) a. Use “Standard Tune” before each run of 300 sample batch. b. Use the “Tuning Solution” (see preparation of solutions below) for the instrument tuning. c. Print the tune report from the standard tune. Rev February 2018 - In ESI(+), check the profile of the calibrant and the intensity of ions m/z 322.0481; m/z 622.0290; and m/z 922.0098, which must be higher than 400k, 500k, and 500k, respectively. d. If the intensity of even one of the selected ions is below this value clean the ion source and repeat the instrument tuning. 3.1.2 Check Reference ions (Instrument in Acquisition mode) a. Use the “Reference Ion Mass Solution” (see preparation of solutions below) for mass correction during the analyses (lock mass). b. Check the following reference ions: - In ESI(+), check the intensity of ions m/z 121.0509 and m/z 980.0164, which should be between 5-20k. Adjust recipe and flow rates to attain this intensity. 3.2 New column installation a. Purge the pumping system of any old buffers and connect the inlet of the column to the injector outlet. Attach the outlet line, but allow flow to go into a beaker instead of to the ion source of mass spectrometer. b. Flush column with 100% Mobile Phase B (see preparation of solution below) with a pump flow rate at 0.4mL/min over 30 minutes. c. Switch to 70% mobile phase A and flush the column for 30 minutes. d. When the mobile phase is flowing freely from the column outlet, stop the flow and attach the column outlet to the ion source of mass spectrometer. e. Switch back to 100% Mobile Phase B and monitor the back pressure until a steady value is achieved. Expected values are between 220-250 bar at the start of the injection. f. Perform 6 "No Injections" and monitor the backpressure on the first and last sample injected. Rev February 2018 NOTE: Use a new column after ~1000 sample injections. The UPLC column must be coupled to a VanGuard pre-column. The VanGuard pre-column is replaced after ~330 sample injections.
