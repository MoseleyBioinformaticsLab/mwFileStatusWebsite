SCHEMA: Section "STUDY" does not match the allowed schema. Wrong key 'CHEAR_STUDY' in OrderedDict([('STUDY_TITLE', 'Pediatric Inner-City Environmental Exposures at School and Home and Asthma Study'), ('STUDY_TYPE', 'CHEAR Study'), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', 'SICAS 1 and SICAS 2 have extraordinary opportunity to evaluate the role of diet, environmental exposures and asthma in the context of school and home specific exposures and capitalize on all the data we are already collecting. Asthma affects 25 million Americans, particularly urban minority children. Children spend nearly all day in school, yet little is known about the role of a child’s exposure to widely disseminated industrial chemicals on asthma morbidity. Early animal models and population studies have begun to identify an association between phenolic chemical exposure and asthma development through proposed increased regulation of an individual’s allergic immune response. This study, nested within a school-based environmental intervention trial, (School Inner-City Asthma Intervention Study, SICAS2) , will enable urinary biomarker analyses during a school-based academic year-long environmental intervention trial to analyze the source and impact of exposures on urinary environmental exposure biomarker levels as well as the relationship between these biomarkers levels and asthma morbidity. We are poised to leverage the clinical and exposure data being collected in the clinical trial and generate cross-sectional urinary phenol biomarker data (at baseline) within the resources of CHEAR. If successful, our study will assess the impact of exposures on these biomarker levels and the impact that these exposures have on asthma morbidity, controlling comprehensively for other personal, home, and school environmental factors associated with asthma outcomes. We hypothesize that exposure to environmental exposures (e.g. phenols, phthalates, environmental tobacco smoke) in urban school children and higher urinary biomarkers will preliminarily be associated with higher asthma morbidity. Specific aims are: Aim 1. To determine the source of exposure to environmental exposures (e.g. phenols, phthalates, environmental tobacco smoke) in inner-city school children as assessed by questionnaire, product use assessment and comprehensive school and home environmental assessment of children with physician-diagnosed asthma. Aim 2. To determine whether urinary phenol/phathalate/cotinine biomarkers are associated with asthma control (e.g. asthma symptoms, such as asthma-related symptom days (primary outcome), and other phenotypes of asthma/allergic symptoms and inflammation such as allergic sensitization, health care utilization and pulmonary lung function'), ('INSTITUTE', 'Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai'), ('DEPARTMENT', 'Department of Environmental Medicine and Public Health'), ('LABORATORY', 'Mount Sinai CHEAR Untargeted Laboratory Hub'), ('LAST_NAME', 'Walker'), ('FIRST_NAME', 'Douglas'), ('ADDRESS', 'Atran Building RM AB3-39, 1428 Madison Ave'), ('EMAIL', 'douglas.walker@mssm.edu'), ('PHONE', '212-241-4392'), ('CHEAR_STUDY', '2016-1407')])
