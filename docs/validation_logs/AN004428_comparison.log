Sections "MS" contain missmatched items: {('MS_COMMENTS', 'The MS analysis was performed using a TimsTOF (Bruker, Darmstadt, Germany) with Apollo II electrospray ionization (ESI) source. The drying gas was set to flow at 10 L/min and the drying temperature to 220C and the nebulizer pressure to 2.2 bar. The capillary voltage was 4500 V and the end plate offset 500V. For metabolomics the scan range was 20-1300 m/z. The collision energy was set to 20 eV, the cycle time to 0.5 seconds with a relative minimum intensity threshold of 400 counts per thousand and target intensity of 20,000. Sodium formate was injected as an external calibrant in the first 0.3 minutes of each LC-MS/MS run. MetaboScape 4.0 software was used for metabolite processing and statistical analysis (Bruker Daltonics). The following parameters for molecular feature identification and bucketing were set in the T-ReX 2D/3D workflow: For peak detection, a minimum intensity threshold of 1,000 counts is required, as well as a minimum peak duration of 7 spectra, with feature quantification determine using peak area. The file masses were recalibrated based on the external calibrant injected between 0-0.3 min.'), ('MS_COMMENTS', 'The MS analysis was performed using a TimsTOF (Bruker, Darmstadt, Germany) with Apollo II electrospray ionization (ESI) source.
