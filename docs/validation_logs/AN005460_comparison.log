Sections "PROJECT" contain missmatched items: {('PROJECT_SUMMARY', "People who visit high altitude (HA) for work, pilgrimage, recreation purposes or deployment are subjected to environmental stresses such as low temperature, atmospheric pressure leading to hypoxia, high radiations, dry air, non-availability of fresh food and vegetables, etc. These environmental stressors pose significant physiological effects on the human body. Among these challenges, hypobaric hypoxia at high altitude affects the aerobic metabolism and thereby reducing the supply of metabolic energy. These alterations could further lead to extreme environment-related maladaptation as evidenced by changes in metabolites and metabolic pathways. In order to investigate the variation in metabolite prfile, urine samples were collected from 16 individual at base line (BL) and at High altitude (HA, 4420m). Untargeted urine metabolic profiling was performed using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in conjunction with statistical analysis. Univariate and Multivariate statistical analysis revealed 33 metabolites based on fold change, (FC &gt;2 and &lt; 0.5), VIP score (&gt;1) and p value (&lt;0.05). These 33 metabolites were primarily associated with pathways related to Phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, Phenylalanine metabolism, Biotin metabolism, Cysteine and methionine metabolism, Tyrosine metabolism, Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, Pentose and glucuronate interconversions, Vitamin B6 metabolism, Citrate cycle (TCA cycle) and Porphyrin metabolism. Further, ROC analysis detected 5 metabolites i.e., 2-Tetrahydrothiopheneacetic acid (AUC: 0.97266), 1-Benzyl-7,8-dimethoxy-3-phenyl-3H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]isoquinoline (AUC: 0.92969), Abietin (AUC:0.917), 4,4'-Thiobis-2-butanone (AUC: 0.917), and Hydroxyisovaleroyl carnitine (AUC: 0.910) with a high range of sensitivity and specificity. In summary, this present longitudinal study demonstrated metabolic changes in human exposed to high altitude, via utilising the potential application of LC-MS metabolomics. These findings will shed light on the impact of hypoxic exposure on metabolic adaptation and provide a better understanding about the pathophysiological mechanism of HA related illnesses correlated to tissue hypoxia."), ('PROJECT_SUMMARY', "People who visit high altitude (HA) for work, pilgrimage, recreation purposes or deployment are subjected to environmental stresses such as low temperature, atmospheric pressure leading to hypoxia, high radiations, dry air, non-availability of fresh food and vegetables, etc. These environmental stressors pose significant physiological effects on the human body.
