Cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 5% Horse serum, EGF 20 ng/mL (Sigma), Insulin 10 μg/mL (Sigma), Hydrocortisone 0.5 mg/mL (Sigma), Cholera toxin 100 ng/mL (Sigma), 100 units/mL Penicillin and 100 μg/mL Streptomycin (HyClone) and grown at 37\uf0b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. To induce EMT, cells were stimulated with 10 ng/mL TGF-β1 (Invivogen) and treatments were staggered such that all cells (plates) were harvested at the same time. To minimize cross-contamination (EV & Sec) and promiscuous background signaling (particularly for Phos), cells were cultured in serum-free conditions for 16 hours prior to harvesting. At the time of harvest, conditioned media were first transferred to fresh 50 mL tubes and kept on ice. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and scraped off the plates in ice-cold PBS. Each sample was then distributed into multiple aliquots for multi-omics extractions, centrifuged at 800×g for 5 minutes at 4°C and stored as dry pellets at –80°C. Live cells were imaged in their culture vessels before harvesting using ZOE fluorescent cell imager (Bio-Rad).'), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'Human breast epithelial MCF10A cells were kindly provided by Prof. Senthil Muthuswamy (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School).

Deep proteomic profiles of whole cells, nuclei, extracellular vesicles, secretome, membrane and phosphoproteome defined state-specific signatures and major transition points. Parallel metabolomics showed metabolic reprogramming preceded changes in other layers, while single-cell RNA sequencing identified transcription factors controlling entry into E/M. Covariance analysis exposed unexpected discordance between the molecular layers. Integrative causal modeling revealed co-dependencies governing entry into E/M that were verified experimentally using combinatorial inhibition. Overall, this dataset provides an unprecedented resource on TGFβ signaling, EMT and cancer.'), ('PROJECT_SUMMARY', 'Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex cellular program proceeding through a hybrid E/M state linked to cancer-associated stemness, migration and chemoresistance.
