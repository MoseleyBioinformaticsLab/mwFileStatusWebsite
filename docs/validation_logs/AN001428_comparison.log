Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', "Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADP.D  MIM ID's 173900, 601313, 613095) is estimated to affect almost 1/1000 and is the most common genetic cause of end stage renal disease (Torres et al., 2007). While advances have been made in slowing the progression of some other forms of chronic kidney disease, standard treatments have not reduced the need for renal replacement therapy in ADPKD (Spithoven et al., 2014). Unfortunately, several experimental interventions also have recently failed to show significant benefit in slowing the rate of functional decline (Serra et al., 2010; Walz et al., 2010; Schrier et al., 2014; Torres et al., 2014), and the only positive study reported very modest effects (Torres et al., 2012). These findings suggest new treatment strategies are required. A central dogma of molecular genetics is that discovery of the causative genes will lead to identification of key pathways and potential targets for intervention. In the case of ADPKD, the two genes mutated in the disorder, PKD1 and PKD2, were identified almost 20 years ago and yet their functions remain poorly understood. The PKD1 gene product, polycystin-1 (PC1), encodes a large membrane protein that requires the PKD2 gene product, polycystin-2 (PC2), for its trafficking to the primary cilium where the two are thought to form a receptor channel complex (Kim et al., 2014; Cai et al., 2014). What the complex senses and what it signals remains controversial. The primary cilium has emerged as a key player in the pathogenesis of PKD as mutations in dozens of different genes that encode either essential ciliary components or factors in ciliary signaling pathways result in PKD. A recent report suggests that the relationship between the polycystin complex and ciliary signaling is complicated, however.While ablation of primary cilia by mutation of core ciliary components results in cysts, these same perturbations done in the setting of Pkd1 or Pkd2 inactivation results in significant attenuation of cystic disease (Ma et al., 2013). These data suggest that the polycystin complex provides a suppressive signal for a novel, cilia-dependent growth-promoting pathway that is independent of MAPK/ERK, mTOR, or cAMP pathways, three effector pathways previously implicated as major drivers of cyst growth. The identities of the growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting pathways remain unknown. We have taken a systems-based approach to study Pkd1 gene function. Building on our previous work identifying markedly different outcomes in animals with induced Pkd1 inactivation before or after P12 and correlating this susceptibility with metabolic status (Piontek et al., 2007; Menezes et al., 2012), we now show that female sex is partially protective in adult-induced Pkd1 inactivation, that sex differences in metabolic status may account for this effect, and that cells lacking Pkd1 have abnormal fatty acid oxidation. Finally, manipulating diet in Pkd1 mouse models, we demonstrate a positive correlation between lipid content in mouse chow and cystic kidney disease severity. Our results therefore suggest that abnormal lipid metabolism is an intrinsic component of PKD and an important modifier of disease progression."), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', "Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD; MIM ID's 173900, 601313, 613095) is estimated to affect almost 1/1000 and is the most common genetic cause of end stage renal disease (Torres et al., 2007).
