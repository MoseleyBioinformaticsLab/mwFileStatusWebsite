Sections "PROJECT" contain missmatched items: {('PROJECT_SUMMARY', "Untargeted synaptic vesicle lipidomics analysis: Synaptic vesicles were isolated from six animals each of 1-month, 3-month, and 10-month old wild-type mice (JAX strain #: 000664), α-synuclein knockout mice (JAX strain #: 023837), and α-synuclein BAC mice (JAX strain #: 023837) using subcellular fractionation. Vesicles were concentrated using 3 kDa cutoff Amicon ultra centrifugal devices (Millipore). Pellets were resuspended in 100 µl water and homogenized. Protein concentration was determined using absorption at 280 nm. Samples were adjusted to the same concentration to a final volume of 200 µl in 50% methanol. All samples were mixed with a panel of 15 lipid internal standards (Splash LipidMix lot#330707), followed by lipid extraction as previously reported.1 Lipids were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on an Accucore C30 column (2.1 mm id x 150mm) under both positive and negative ion modes. Raw data files were searched and processed using LipidSearch 5.1 (Thermo Scientific) and normalized against the known amount of internal standard lipids for each sample, allowing for reliably quantitative measurements of all 15 categories of lipids.1 1 Bhawal, R., Fu, Q., Anderson, E.T., Gibson, G.E., and Zhang, S.
