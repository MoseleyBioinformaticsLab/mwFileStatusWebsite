Sections "STUDY" contain missmatched items: {('STUDY_SUMMARY', "Depression will be the disease with the highest incidence worldwide by 2030. Data indicate that postmenopausal women have a higher incidence of mood disorders, and this high vulnerability seems to be related to hormonal changes and weight gain. Although research evaluating the profile of metabolites in mood disorders is advancing, further research, maintaining consistent methodology, is necessary to reach a consensus. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to carry out an exploratory analysis of the plasma polar metabolites and lipids of pre- and postmenopausal women to explore whether the profile is affected by depression. The study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Universidade Federal de São Paulo (nº 0624/2019) and all participants signed the informed consent. 42 premenopausal and 67 postmenopausal women had the depression symptoms assessed by the Beck Depression's Inventory (BDI). Lipids and polar metabolites were extracted from plasma and analyzed in an ultra-performance liquid chromatography system (UHPLC) coupled to a spectrometer with a triple-quadrupole analyzer operating with an electrospray ionization source (ESI) in positive and negative mode. Lipids and polar metabolites analyses was performed using MetaboAnalyst 5.0. Ten metabolites were significantly affected by depression symptoms in postmenopause, including Adenosine, Guanosine, Proline, Citrulline, Lysine, and Carnitine, which were down-regulated, and Dimethylglycine, Glutathione, Creatine, and Methionine that were up-regulated. In premenopausal women with depression, Oxidized Glutathione was down-regulated, and Dimethylglycine and 4-hydroxyproline were up-regulated. Seven lipids were were significantly affected by depression symptoms in pre-menopausal women PC(36:1)/PC(18:1(9Z)/18:0), PC(19:0/19:0), and LTB4 were up-regulated and PC(18:0/14:0)/GPCho(18:0/14:0), SM(d18:1/16:0), LysoPC(18:1(9z))/LPC 18:1, and Azelaoyl-PAF were down-regulated. In post-menopausal women PC(16:1(9z)/16:1(9z)) and 14,15-DHET were down-regulated and acetylcarnitine was up-regulated. Though there seems to be a relationship in the occurrence of obesity and depression in women the hormonal status influenced the effect of depression in women and that this status may be taken into account when searching for a marker for depression."), ('STUDY_SUMMARY', "Depression will be the disease with the highest incidence worldwide by 2030.
