Sections "COLLECTION" contain missmatched items: {('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'Coral colonies were brought to the surface intact, and ~3 cm nubbins were clipped from actively growing branch tips. Nubbins were wrapped in aluminum foil and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Nubbins were then ground down in an ice chilled mortar pastel in 10 mL of 2:1 Chloroform/Methanol solution. Supernatant was then transferred into a test tube labeled with sample I.D. and Organic and vortexed for 10 seconds. 2 mL of .9% NaCl was then added to each tube and vortexed for an additional 10 seconds. Samples were then allowed to separate for 15 minutes on ice. After the allotted time, the supernatant was separated and placed in a separate test tube labeled with sample I.D. and Aqueous. Both test tubes were then stored in a -80°C freezer until processing.'), ('COLLECTION_SUMMARY', 'Coral colonies were brought to the surface intact, and ~3 cm nubbins were clipped from actively growing branch tips.
